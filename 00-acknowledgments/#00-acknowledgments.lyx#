Scientific computing, by means of computer-science methodology, makes possible
 the study of problems that are too complex to be treated analytically,
 or those that are very expensive or dangerous to be studied by direct experimen
tation.
 Real-world problems are typically very complex systems to be directly assessed
 by analytical models, and require a numerical simulation for their study.
 Computer simulations provide a resource to mimic the behavior of complex
 systems, by numerically evaluating a model and gathering its data to estimate
 their true characteristics

\begin_layout Standard
A model is a simple representation of a studied problem, and one of its
 purposes is to predict the effects of variations within the system.
 A good model is a balance between realism and simplicity.
 The system simulation, on the other hand, is the operation of the model.
 Its configuration can also be changed, allowing multiple experimental execution
s, something that might not be possible with the real system it represents

Problems that are categorized as of large size and of considerable complexity
 represent a challenge because of the different involved disciplines and
 the degree of difficulty of their modeling.
 The optimization of 3G radio networks falls under this characterization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A quick review of the state-of-the-art in 3G network optimization indicates
 that software, providing good computational models, is a very expensive
 tool for science.
 Moreover, since the vast majority of this software is proprietary, it relies
 on closed source, formats and protocols, which disclosure is explicitly
 forbidden by their licenses.
 This fact creates a big hurdle to one of the key phases of scientific methodolo
gy

: experimental reproducibility.

\begin_layout Standard
There is a constant growing demand for hardware resources, longer-processing
 times and more memory to follow the evolution of 3G radio networks

 Fortunately, high-performance computer systems are increasingly accessible;
 something made possible because of the emergence of computer clusters and
 commodity hardware, capable of true parallel processing, e.g.
 multi-core CPUs

 and GPUs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, the highly parallel structure present on GPUs makes them more
 effective than CPUs for execution of algorithms where large blocks of data
 need to be processed in parallel.
 Commodity GPUs have evolved from being a graphic accelerator into a general-pur
pose processor.
 They can achieve higher performance at lower power consumption and lower
 costs when compared to conventional CPUs.

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to understand that the models used in scientific simulations
 and engineering never offer a perfect model of the system they represent,
 but only a subset of its composition and dynamics.
 Experimentation and expert observation will always be essential as reference
 points for understanding the studied phenomena.

Radio-network optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mobile radio communications represent one of the most fast-growing technology
 markets since the introduction of the second generation (2G) mobile networks.
 One of the most popular implementations from this generation is the Global
 System for Mobile communications (GSM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "3GPP_TR_50.099"

\end_inset

.
 Its successor, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "3GPP_TR_23.101"

\end_inset

, marks an evolution from 2G, representing a milestone for the third generation
 of mobile radio networks (3G).
 Since then, the increasing demand for more bandwidth has pushed the availabilit
y of high-speed data services in order to improve the user's experience.
 Once a mobile network is launched, an important part of its operation and
 maintenance is monitoring the quality characteristics and changing parameter
 values in order to improve its performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The evolution from 2G to 3G has introduced not only the technology needed
 to increase both data and voice capacity, but also a greater complexity
 in terms of network planning, deployment, and configuration, which have
 rendered most of the traditionally used methods to be ineffective.
 In a traditional approach (i.e.
 manual), during the network planning and maintenance processes, a network
 planning software tool would execute the analysis, while the human would
 make the change decisions.
 Therefore, a radio planning engineer configures network parameters manually
 and the network planning tool analyzes the given configuration.
 If the obtained results are not acceptable, the analysis process has to
 be repeated several times, until the goal is achieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern 3G radio networks are large and many of their key parameters are
 interdependent.
 Since an engineer is not able to cope with the level of complexity present
 in such systems, the computer, along with specialized software, guides
 the engineer to the most appropriate configuration for the network.
 In the context of this work, we will refer to this process as optimization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common limitation of the implementations of such optimization methods,
 generally targeting traditional computer architectures of sequential execution,
 is their inability to meet the requirements needed by real-world mobile
 networks, since their computational-time complexity make them unfeasible
 for practical use.
 When analyzing big real-world networks with thousands of users it is necessary
 to reduce the execution time of the optimization processes as much as possible,
 so that they are useful for practical use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the considerable number of publications in the field of 3G radio
 network optimization, of which we cite just a few for reference purposes

\end_inset

, most of them base their simulations on platforms for which it is not possible
 to reproduce the experiments, either because the software used is proprietary
 or the data is not available.
 We believe that the creation of an open and standardized framework would
 be a great benefit for the field of radio networks, as it would allow researche
rs to compare different methods and results in an easy, fast, and objective
 manner.
 An interesting effort in this direction is the MOMENTUM project 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "momentum2010"

\end_inset

.
 It was created with the objective of setting up a standardized experimental
 environment that would facilitate research cooperation and ultimately improve
 collaboration in the field of 3G radio networks.
 Unfortunately, there is no radio network simulator included and there have
 been no updates in the project since 2005, when the last data corrections
 were released.
 This situation represents a deficit for the engineering and scientific
 community, since an open simulation framework will ease the use, reproduction,
 and sharing of data, related to maintenance and optimization of 3G radio
 networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the implementation of the framework will benefit from valuable
 advances in computer science and High Performance Computing (HPC), in order
 to perform faster and more reliable simulations
