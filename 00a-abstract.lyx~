Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complexity of the design of radio networks has grown with the adoption
 of modern standards.
 Therefore, the role of the computer for the faster delivery of accurate
 results has become increasingly important.
 In this thesis, novel methods for the planning and automatic optimization
 of radio networks are developed and discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms, which compare a large number
 of different network configurations, rely on model-based simulations for
 the evaluation of the solution quality and the exploration of the search
 space.
 However, current radio-network solutions, based on snapshot simulations,
 have major weaknesses with respect to the simulation time and flexibility
 provided.
 In particular, the size of networks that can be analyzed in a feasible
 time is typically very limited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The new unified framework developed in this thesis significantly outperforms
 the currently available solutions for snapshot-based, radio-network simulations.
 It brings together novel and state-of-the-art parallelization methods,
 in order to allow for a detailed analysis of very large networks within
 an acceptable amount of time for everyday planning.
 This is achieved by the parallel features of the framework, which are exploitab
le on a single multi-core CPU, as well as on a network of standard PCs with
 GPU devices.
 Clearly, the significant speed-up achieved at the simulation stage allows
 for an increased level of detail of the simulations, which improves the
 accuracy of the results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Increasing the performance of the simulations involved during the objective-func
tion evaluation is only the first step towards a practical running-time
 reduction for radio-network optimization.
 In addition to this, also the optimization algorithms have to be improved
 in terms of speed, but not at the expense of the quality of results.
 In this sense, a novel agent-based algorithm is presented and tailored
 to a classic optimization problem in radio networks.
 The algorithm, which is based on several techniques of cellular automata
 and population-based metaheuristics, shows considerable gains with respect
 to the size of problem instances it may handle, as well as regarding its
 speed performance and solution quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to take advantage of the achieved speed-up at the simulation
 stage is to tackle problems of greater complexity.
 This thesis identifies a new optimization problem in 3G radio networks
 that deals with soft-handover balancing of downlink and uplink areas.
 Using a black-box approach, different metaheuristic algorithms are employed
 for solving the problem, the solutions of which show a substantial improvement
 of downlink and uplink balance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the practical point of view, the automation of time-consuming, radio-planni
ng tasks is yet another way to exploit the benefits of faster and more precise
 simulations.
 One such task is the configuration of the control parameters of empirical
 radio-propagation models.
 Another one is identified with the environmental adaptation of the signal
 losses due to clutter.
 Both tasks are automated, using the parallel framework as a central component
 of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The utility and performance of the developed methods is assessed against
 an enterprise, commercial tool for radio-network planning.
 The objective of such comparison is to determine the usage properties of
 the parallel framework in everyday planning, using real-world scenarios.

There is a constant growing demand for hardware resources, longer-processing
 times and more memory to follow the evolution of 3G radio networks

 Fortunately, high-performance computer systems are increasingly accessible;
 something made possible because of the emergence of computer clusters and
 commodity hardware, capable of true parallel processing, e.g.
 multi-core CPUs

.
 Moreover, the highly parallel structure present on GPUs makes them more
 effective than CPUs for execution of algorithms where large blocks of data
 need to be processed in parallel.
 Commodity GPUs have evolved from being a graphic accelerator into a general-pur
pose processor.
 They can achieve higher performance at lower power consumption and lower
 costs when compared to conventional CPUs.
 Additionally, the implementation of the framework will benefit from valuable
 advances in computer science and High Performance Computing (HPC), in order
 to perform faster and more reliable simulations
