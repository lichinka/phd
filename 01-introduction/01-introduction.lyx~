Many researchers believe the computer has become the third method to do
 research, behind theory and experimentation, for both science and engineering.
 Although there is no complete agreement on the position intended for scientific
 computing with respect to the other two methods, it is undeniable that
 computational methods are an essential tool in most disciplines, particularly
 in those related to decision making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nowadays, decision making is present practially everywhere.
 As scientistis, engineers and managers have to make decisions in more complex
 and competitive circumnstances every day, decision making involves dealing
 with rational and optimal approaches.
 According to Talbi 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Talbi_Metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

, decision making consists in the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
formulate the problem,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
model the problem, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
optimize the problem, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
implement a solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formulating a decision problem means making an initial statement about it.
 Despite this first formulation may be imprecise, the objectives of the
 problem are outlined, together with internal and external factors that
 have some degree of influence over it.
 During the modelling of the problem, an abstract mathematical model is
 built for it.
 Sometimes this model is inspired by similar models in the literature, making
 it possible to tackle the problem with well-studied methods.
 After a model of the problem is available, the optimization step, i.e.
 generating 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solutions for the problem, may begin.
 It is worth pointing out that the resulting solutions are given for the
 abstract model, and not for the original problem itself.
 Therefore, the performance of the obtained solution is indicative when
 the model is an accurate one 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Talbi_Metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

.
 In the last step, the obtained solution is practically tested by the decision
 maker and implemented if it is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

acceptable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

bad

 or

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 solutions, the decision-making process is repeated, possibly improving
 the model and/or the optimization algorithm.
 The process, as described here, is depicted in Figure

Scientific computing, by means of computer-science methodology, makes possible
 the study of problems that are too complex to be treated analytically,
 or those that are very expensive or dangerous to be studied by direct experimen
tation.
 Real-world problems are typically very complex systems to be directly assessed
 by analytical models, and require a numerical simulation for their study.
 Computer simulations provide a resource to mimic the behavior of complex
 systems, by numerically evaluating a model and gathering its data to estimate
 their true characteristics

\begin_layout Standard
A model is a simplified representation of a studied problem, and one of
 its purposes is to predict the effects of variations within the system.
 A good model is a balance between realism and simplicity.
 The system simulation, on the other hand, is the operation of the model.
 Its configuration can also be changed, allowing multiple experimental execution
s, something that might not be possible with the real system it represents

.
 However, it is important to understand that the models used in scientific
 simulations and engineering never offer a perfect model of the system they
 represent, but only a subset of its composition and dynamics.
 For this reason, experimentation and expert observation will always be
 essential as reference points for understanding the studied phenomena.
 Consequently, problems categorized as of large size and of considerable
 complexity represent a challenge, because of the different involved disciplines
 and the degree of difficulty of their modeling.
 Radio networks, in particular those of the third and fourth generations,
 fall under this characterization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Radio networks represent one of the most fast-growing technology markets
 since the introduction of the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM

 of mobile radio networks (3G
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

).
 In recent years, the first commercial networks implementing the Long Term

), also known as fourth generation (4G

) LTE, have also appeared [ref???].
 The always increasing demand for more bandwidth has been one of the main
 forces behind the standardization and later implementation of systems deliverin
g higher speed data services in order to improve the user's experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This evolution, first from 2G to 3G and later from 3G to 4G, has introduced
 not only the technology needed to increase both data-transfer capacity
 and voice quality, but also a greater complexity in terms of radio-network
 planning, deployment, and configuration.
 This fact has attracted the attention of the research community into areas
 such as the design and optimization of radio-networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a traditional or manual approach, during the design phase of a radio
 network, a software tool would execute the analysis, while the human would
 make the change decisions.
 Therefore, a radio engineer configures the network parameters manually
 and the software tool analyzes the given configuration.
 If the obtained results are not acceptable, the analysis process has to
 be repeated several times, until the goal is achieved.
 We will refer to this process as manual radio-network optimization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Advances in the last few years have improved the manual optimization process
 by introducing different problem-solving approaches that increase the role
 the computer has during the optimization of radio networks, consequently
 enlarging the scope of problems and instance sizes that may be subject
 to automated optimization.
 Still, there are some important aspects that restrict the utilization of
 these methods not only in real-world enviroments, but also when doing research
 in the area of optimization of radio networks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is usually the case that the selected method is a compromise between
 solution quality and computational-time complexity.
 The proposed state-of-the-art approach for the evaluation of radio networks
 is the Monte-Carlo snapshot analysis.
 However, real-world environments, where radio-network design is carried
 out, require the evaluation of networks comprising up to thousands of base
 stations in a reasonable amount of time.
 Moreover, for applications involving radio-network optimization, multiple
 thousand evaluations are required to find a good solution, in which case
 also snapshot simulations are too time-consuming to be employed.
 Therefore, for such applications and environments, methods with improved
 time efficiency are required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A considerable number of publications in the field of radio-network optimization
, of which we cite just a few for reference purposes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "amaldi2007radio_planning,siomina2007minimum_pilot_power,chen2008automated,chen2009fast,gordejuela2009two,siomina2008enhancing"

\end_inset

, base their simulations on platforms for which it is not possible to reproduce
 the experiments, either because they have used proprietary software or
 because the data is not available.
 This fact reduces the possibilities for comparing different approaches
 among each other, and significantly contrasts with other research areas,
 such as evolutionary computing or artificial intellingence, which have
 a set of open and well-known benchmarks for the community to use.
 Thus, an open and standardized framework would allow researchers to compare
 different methods and results in a simple and objective manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Available commercial tools for radio-network evaluation have major drawbacks
 with respect to the size of networks that can be considered, simulation
 time, and especially the accuracy of the modeled system.
 Yet, if precise and fast methods were commercially available, the would
 lack the level of flexibility required by the scientific community.
 Consequently, an essential attribute of the framework is to be open source,
 so that anyone could extend it to meet some specific requirements.
 In the long term, this process should also extend the set of built-in functiona
lity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Particularly for path-loss predictions, created with empirical mathematical
 models, the inaccuracy of the input data directly deteriorates the precision
 of the calculated results.
 Moreover, since the physical properties that influence the propagation
 of radio signals are not constant and every environment introduces its
 own deviations, the calculated coverage may be considered as not more than
 an approximation.
 Therefore, there is a need for a method to adapt state-of-the-art mathematical
 models for radio propagations so that the calculated path-loss predictions
 are as accurate as possible, despite the various sources of error noted
 before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis focuses on providing methods and tools to ??? the pointed drawbacks.
 Short summary of the introduced novelties??? It is important to note that
 some methods proposed in this thesis have been particularly designed for
 problems emerging in radio planning of 3G networks.
 Despite this, they may be adapted to other standards, e.g.
 GSM or LTE, without lose of generality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this thesis, we intend to contribute methods and tools that will provide
 solutions to the disadvantages pointed out in the previous section.
 The introduced methods and tools have a close correlation with the simulation
 and optimization of radio networks, especially those of the 3G and 4G.
 We will introduce the steps necessary to mitigate the problem of experimental
 reproducibility found in most published works, by simplifying setup, execution,
 and sharing of experimental results.
 With the development of the framework, we will evaluate and assess the
 possibilities it offers as a support system for simulation and optimization
 problems of radio networks.
 By including parallel programming techniques for computer clusters and
 GPUs, we intend to go beyond the classical methodology provided by previous
 works, taking advantage of the inherent parallelism of some optimization
 techniques.
 We will also be looking into the application of many advances in HPC that
 should provide the framework with the computing power needed to improve
 the simulation process, thus enhancing its scalability to support real-world
 3G radio networks.
 Finally, since we believe that this work will only become truly productive
 through the cooperation and long-term development of the scientific and
 engineering community, we will be releasing the source code, algorithms,
 documentation, and data to the public domain.
 This way, anyone will be able to use and to extend the framework for their
 own needs.
 Encouraging cooperation and sharing of experimentation-related tools and
 data should be a common goal from which everyone will benefit.

\begin_layout Section
Hypothesis and aims
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The great proportion of published works about optimization problems for
 3G radio networks is very difficult to reproduce, if possible at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A common and open framework, designed for simulation of 3G radio networks,
 should mitigate the experimental reproducibility problem by simplifying
 sharing of experimental results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Parallelization techniques improve the scalability and time requirement
 of the framework, thus making it possible to process real-world data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using hardware, specialized for parallel execution (e.g.
 GPU), improves the time requirement of parallel algorithms using threads
 or message-passing mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aims
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Analyze the state-of-the-art of optimization problems for 3G radio networks
 in general, and UMTS in particular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Identify common obstacles in optimization problems for 3G radio networks
 that prevent them from being reproducible by other members of the research
 community.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design and implement framework tools to provide a common open environment
 that will enable the scientific community to easily share and reproduce
 different experimental conditions for maintenance and optimization of 3G
 radio networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Integrate parallelization techniques to provide framework scalability, so
 that it will be able to deal with large real-world data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Evaluate the framework design by reproducing optimization environments and
 introducing new algorithms for tackling previously unsolved instances of
 optimization problems in 3G radio networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Evaluate and analyze all experimental results and simulations in the context
 of real networks, using real-world data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dissertation will use the following methodology to prove the hypothesis
 stated in the previous sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we will survey existing optimization problems and techniques for
 3G radio networks in general, and UMTS in particular.
 The focus of the survey will be on optimization problems that do not provide
 the means required by experimental reproducibility and require the use
 of a snapshot-based model of the radio network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, we will design and develop a parallel framework for radio network
 simulations.
 The development of the framework will focus on joining optimization and
 simulation, so that it will cover a wider range of use cases, namely as
 a maintenance and optimization tool for 3G radio networks.
 Additionally, we will make an intensive study of the mathematical models
 currently used, seeking to assess their reliability when used in simulations
 of 3G radio networks.
 Since the algorithms and simulations used in the optimization of 3G radio
 networks consume large amounts of data and require high computing power
 (due to the large number of simulations they need to run), we will improve
 the performance of the framework even more by adapting its most time-consuming
 parts for execution on GPUs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we will evaluate the benefits of the above-mentioned framework
 by conducting reproducible experiments that will support the hypothesis
 outlined under ???, by tackling similar and bigger problem instances when
 solving both well-known and new optimization problems for 3G radio networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expected contributions of this dissertation to the fields of telecommunicati
ons and computer sciences include the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
State-of-the-art overview of optimization methods for 3G radio networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design and development of a framework that provides an open environment
 for radio network simulations, implemented for execution on computer clusters
 and GPUs.
 The framework will allow the scientific community to share a common domain
 to run the simulations needed by modern optimization methods, since most
 currently available simulation tools are proprietary and therefore unsuitable
 for experimental reproducibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Improvement of quality and speed of renowned mathematical models, used for
 radio propagation predictions, by applying parameter optimization and paralleli
zation techniques.
 The expected speed improvement should be of at least one order of magnitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Proposal of a new algorithm, based on autonomous agents, to solve the service
 coverage problem.
 The solved problem instances should be of bigger size than ever solved
 in the literature and reach equal or better quality thereof.
 This should make our approach applicable for large real-world problem instances
 and data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Identification of a new optimization problem in 3G radio networks that deals
 with soft-handover alignment of downlink and uplink areas.
 By solving this problem, we should avoid abnormal network functioning in
 areas where there is soft-handover capability in the uplink, but none in
 the downlink.
 So far this problem has been solved manually by radio experts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Empirical comparison of the proposed metaheuristic algorithm against the
 existing state-of-the-art optimization algorithms on the soft-handover
 alignment problem.

 present an overview of some well-known optimization problems that occur
 during deployment and configuration of mobile networks.
 A description of each optimization problem is given, followed by a short
 survey of recently proposed optimization methods.
 It closes by giving a conclusion regarding mobile networks and why they

 deals with the automatic tuning of parameters of the mathematical models,
 used for radio propagation predictions.
 Namely, based on field measurements, the configurable parameters of the
 mathematical models used by the framework may be automatically tuned to
 minize the deviation from the prediction to the actual state of the network.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, a static network simulator is used to find downlink and uplink SHO areas.
 By introducing a penalty-based objective function and some hard constraints,
 we formally define the problem of balancing SHO areas in UMTS networks.
 The state-of-the-art mathematical model used and the penalty scores of
 the objective function are set according to the configuration and layout
 of a real mobile network, deployed in Slovenia by Telekom Slovenije, d.d..
 The balancing problem is then tackled by three optimization algorithms,
 each of them belonging to a different category of metaheuristics.
 We report and analyze the optimization results, as well as the performance
 of each of the optimization algorithms used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter

 considers the problem of minimizing the total amount of pilot power subject
 to a full coverage constraint.
 Our optimization approach, based on parallel autonomous agents, gives very
 good solutions to the problem within an acceptable amount of time.
 The parallel implementation takes full advantage of GPU hardware in order
 to achieve impressive speed-up.
 We report the results of our experiments for three UMTS networks of different
 sizes based on a real network currently deployed in Slovenia.
