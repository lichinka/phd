Many researchers believe the computer has become the third method to do
 research, behind theory and experimentation, for both science and engineering.
 Although there is no complete agreement on the position intended for scientific
 computing with respect to the other two methods, it is undeniable that
 computational methods are an essential tool in most disciplines, particularly
 in those related to decision making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nowadays, decision making is present practially everywhere.
 As scientistis, engineers and managers have to make decisions in more complex
 and competitive circumnstances every day, decision making involves dealing
 with rational and optimal approaches.
 According to Talbi 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Talbi_Metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

, decision making consists of the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
formulating the problem,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
modeling the problem, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
optimizing the problem, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
implementing a solution for the problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formulating a decision problem means making an initial statement about it.
 Although this first formulation may be imprecise, the objectives of the
 problem are outlined, together with the internal and external factors that
 have some degree of influence over it.
 During the modeling of the problem, an abstract mathematical model is built
 for it.
 Sometimes this model is inspired by similar models in the literature, making
 it possible to tackle the problem with well-studied methods.
 After a model of the problem is available, the optimization step, i.e., generatin
g

\end_inset

 solutions for the problem, may begin.
 It is important to note that the resulting solutions are given for the
 abstract model, and not for the original problem itself.
 Therefore, the performance of the obtained solution is indicative when
 the model is an accurate one 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Talbi_Metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

.
 In the last step, the obtained solution is practically tested by the decision
 maker and implemented if it is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

acceptable
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 or

 solutions, the decision-making process is repeated, possibly improving
 the model and/or the optimization algorithm.
 The process, as described here, is depicted in Figure

Scientific computing, by means of computer-science methodology, enables
 the study of problems that are too complex to be treated analytically,
 or those that are very expensive or dangerous to be studied by direct experimen
tation.
 Real-world problems are typically very complex systems to be directly assessed
 by analytical models, and require a numerical simulation for their study.
 Computer simulations provide a resource to mimic the behavior of complex
 systems, by numerically evaluating a model and gathering its data to estimate
 their true characteristics

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A model is a simplified representation of a studied problem, and one of
 its purposes is to predict the effects of the variations within the system.
 A good model is a balance between realism and simplicity.
 The system simulation, on the other hand, is the operation of the model.
 Its configuration can be changed, thus allowing multiple experimental execution
s, something that might not be possible with the real system it represents
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "maria1997introduction"

\end_inset

.
 However, it is important to understand that the models used in scientific
 simulations and engineering never offer a perfect representation of the
 system they resemble, but only a subset of its composition and dynamics.
 For this reason, experimentation and expert observation will always be
 essential as reference points for understanding the studied phenomena.
 Consequently, problems categorized as of large size and of considerable
 complexity represent a challenge, because of the different involved disciplines
 for their study and the degree of difficulty of their modeling.
 Cellular radio networks in general, and those of the lastest generations
 in particular, fall under this categorization.

Problem statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Radio networks represent one of the most fast-growing technology markets
 since the introduction of the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 As an implementation of the second generation of mobile networks (2G
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

\end_inset

), GSM appeared more than twenty years ago.
 Its successor, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

description "Universal Mobitel Telecommunications System."

\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 marks an evolution from 2G, representing a milestone for the third generation
 of mobile radio networks (3G
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
prefix "A"
symbol "3G"
description "Third Generation of mobile networks."

\end_inset

).
 In recent years, the first commercial networks implementing the Long Term
 Evolution (LTE
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

description "Long Term Evolution."

\end_inset

), also known as fourth generation (4G

\end_inset

) LTE, have also appeared 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Gerstenberger-Introduction_to_LTE:2011"

\end_inset

.
 The always increasing demand for more bandwidth has been one of the main
 forces behind the standardization and later implementation of systems deliverin
g higher-speed data services in order to improve the user's experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This evolution, first from 2G to 3G and later from 3G to 4G, has introduced
 not only the technology needed to increase data-transfer capacity and voice
 quality, but also a greater complexity in terms of radio-network planning,
 deployment, and configuration.
 This fact has attracted the attention of the research community into areas
 such as the design and optimization of radio-networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the design phase of a radio network, a traditional or manual approach
 comprises the software tool, i.e., the model in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:01-decision_making_process"

\end_inset

, that executes the analysis, and the human that makes the configuration
 changes, i.e., the optimization in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:01-decision_making_process"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, a radio engineer manually adjusts the network parameters and
 the software tool analyzes the given configuration.
 If the obtained results are not acceptable, the analysis process has to
 be repeated several times, until the goal is achieved and the changes are
 implemented, i.e., the implementation in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:01-decision_making_process"

\end_inset

.
 In the context of this thesis, this process is refered to as manual radio-netwo
rk optimization.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Advances in the past few years have improved the manual optimization process
 by introducing different problem-solving approaches that increase the role
 of the computer during the optimization of radio networks, consequently
 enlarging the scope of problems and instance sizes that may be subject
 to optimization.
 Still, there are some important aspects that restrict the automation level
 of these methods, not only in real-world enviroments, but also when doing
 research in the area of radio networks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A selected optimization method is typically a compromise between solution
 quality and computational-time complexity.
 The proposed state-of-the-art approach for the evaluation of radio networks
 is the Monte-Carlo snapshot analysis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Turke-Efficient_methods_for_WCDMA_radio_network_planning_and_optimization:2007,Wacker-Static_simulator_for_studying_WCDMA_radio_network_planning;1999"

\end_inset

.
 However, real-world environments, where radio-network design is carried
 out, require the evaluation of networks with thousands of base stations
 in a reasonable amount of time.
 Moreover, for applications involving radio-network optimization, usually
 millions of evaluations are required to find a good solution, in which
 case also snapshot simulations are too time-consuming for practical use.
 Therefore, for such applications and environments, methods with improved
 time efficiency are required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A considerable number of publications in the field of radio-network optimization
, a few references of which are given for illustration purposes 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "amaldi2007radio_planning,chen2008automated,chen2009fast,gordejuela2009two,siomina2008enhancing,siomina2007minimum_pilot_power"

\end_inset

, base their simulations on platforms for which it is not possible to reproduce
 the experiments, either because they have used proprietary software or
 because the data is not available.
 This fact reduces the possibilities for comparing different approaches
 among each other, and significantly contrasts with other research areas,
 such as evolutionary computing or numerical optimization, where several
 sets of open and well-known benchmarks are available for the community
 to use.
 Consequently, an open and unified framework should allow researchers to
 compare different methods and results in a simplified and objective manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Available commercial tools for radio-network evaluation present several
 drawbacks.
 In particular, regarding to the size of networks that can be considered
 and their computational-time complexity.
 Yet, even if precise and fast methods were commercially available, the
 would lack the level of flexibility required by the scientific community.
 Consequently, an essential attribute of the framework is to be open source,
 so that anyone can extend it to meet some specific requirements.
 In the long term, this process should also extend the set of built-in functiona
lity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Particularly for path-loss predictions, estimated with empirical or deterministi
c mathematical models, the inaccuracy of the input data directly deteriorates
 the precision of the calculated results.
 Moreover, since the physical properties that influence the propagation
 of radio signals are not constant and every environment introduces its
 own deviations, the calculated prediction may be considered as not more
 than a rough approximation.
 Therefore, there is a need for a technique that improves the accuracy of
 the state-of-the-art mathematical models for radio propagations, despite
 the various sources of error noted before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This thesis introduces methods and tools to mitigate the above-mentioned
 drawbacks from a radio-planning perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Hypotheses and approaches
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work presented in this thesis is based on the following hypotheses and
 their related approaches:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Applying parallelization techniques should reduce the computational-time
 requirement of the radio-propagation prediction, thus making it possible
 to process larger, real-world radio networks.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Unlike several examples in the literature of radio-network simulators, which
 do not include support for parallel methods in order to reduce the computationa
l-time complexity, the unified framework includes this feature in its basic
 structure.
 In this sense, parallel techniques are used even when targeting a single
 computing host.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Using hardware, specialized for parallel execution (e.g., GPU), should improve
 the execution time of parallel algorithms using threads or message-passing
 mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
From its arrival a few years ago, general GPU programming is continously
 gaining the attention of the research community and it is extending to
 several areas of science.
 In particular, the combination of parallel-programming techniques with
 GPU hardware should reduce the computational-time requirement of the radio-prop
agation prediction even further.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Using the parallel framework for the objective-function evaluation of different
 optimization problems should improve the quality of solutions and enable
 tackling larger problem instances.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
On the one hand, a larger number of evaluations in the same amount of time
 translates in a better search of the search space by the optimization algorithm
 used.
 On the other hand, more complex or exact models may be evaluated in the
 same amount of time, which implies more accurate solutions.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Using the parallel framework to evaluate the objective function of an automatic-
optimization system should provide the means for solving new, previously
 inaccessible optimization problems.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The improved performance at the evaluation level opens new possibilities
 for formally defining and tackling oprimization problems that were previously
 out-of-reach of state-of-the-art methods, either because of their complexity
 or size.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section
Scientific contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contributions of this thesis to the fields of telecommunications and
 computer sciences include the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design and development of an unified framework for radio-network planning
 and optimization, incorporating the following two elements, as well as
 experimentation on real-world radio networks.
 The experimentation includes a comparison with a commercial tool that is
 currently being used for real radio-network planning.
 Moreover, the parallel implementation of the framework exploits the computing
 resources of computer clusters and GPUs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Proposal of a new approach for parallel programming that combines a classic
 master-worker method with an external database.
 The proposed approach improves the scalability of the classic master-worker
 paradigm by preventing the master process to become the bottleneck of a
 parallel system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Quality improvement of renowned radio-propagation models by applying metaheurist
ic-optimization techniques that enhance the results of current state-of-the-art
 methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A new algorithm, based on autonomous agents, to tackle the service-coverage
 problem in radio networks.
 The algorithm deals with problem instances that are out-of-reach of other
 state-of-the-art techniques, reaching good quality of solutions if compared
 to classic network-planning techniques.
 This approach is applicable for large real-world radio networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Identification of a new optimization problem in 3G radio networks that deals
 with soft-handover alignment of downlink and uplink areas.
 By solving this problem, network malfunctioning is avoided in areas where
 there is soft-handover capability in the uplink, but none in the downlink.
 So far this problem has never been solved by means of automatic optimization.

A number of previous publications underlie this thesis.
 The initial work on activity recognition was published by Lustrek and Kaluza
 (2009).
 To address the challenges caused by sensor noise, Kaluza and Dovgan (2009)
 developed and published pre-processing ltering techniques, while Kaluza
 (2009) published the removal of spurious activity transitions (post-processing).
 The complete activity recognition pipeline was then fully applied and rst
 published at the European Conference on Ambient Intelligence (Lustrek et
 al., 2009).
 This publication enabled analyzing high-level behavior patterns such as
 spatio-activity matrices, which in turn was published at the International
 Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining (Kaluza and Gams, 2010)
 and won the best student paper award.
 The paper was then further extended and published in Journal of Ambient
 Intelligence and Smart Enviroments (Kaluza and Gams, 2012).
 The initial ideas for repeated anomalous and suspicious behavior detection's
 theoretical foundations were published at the PAIR workshop at the AAAI
 Conference on Articial Intelligence (Kaluza et al., 2011e), and then distilled
 along with the F-UPR detector as a full paper at the International Conference
 on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (Kaluza et al., 2012b).
 Empirical studies on the ambient assisted living domain were also published
 at the Inter- national Joint Conference on Ambient Intelligence (Kaluza
 et al., 2010b) and demonstrated at the European Conference on Articial Intellige
nce (Lustrek et al., 2012) and the Inter- national Conference on Autonomous
 Agents and Multiagent Systems (Kaluza et al., 2012a).
 Results on the security domain were published in the Journal of Ambient
 Intelligence and Smart Environments (Dovgan et al., 2010b) and Expert Systems
 with Applications (Kaluza et al., 2011c).
 The comprehensive list of related publications is collected in Appendix
