It is important to understand that the models used in scientific simulations
 and engineering never offer a perfect model of the system they represent,
 but only a subset of its composition and dynamics.
 Experimentation and expert observation will always be essential as reference
 points for understanding the studied phenomena.

\begin_layout Section
Radio-network optimization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a mobile network is launched, an important part of its operation and
 maintenance is monitoring the quality characteristics and changing parameter
 values in order to improve its performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The evolution from 2G to 3G has introduced not only the technology needed
 to increase both data and voice capacity, but also a greater complexity
 in terms of network planning, deployment, and configuration, which have
 rendered most of the traditionally used methods to be ineffective.
 In a traditional approach (i.e.
 manual), during the network planning and maintenance processes, a network
 planning software tool would execute the analysis, while the human would
 make the change decisions.
 Therefore, a radio planning engineer configures network parameters manually
 and the network planning tool analyzes the given configuration.
 If the obtained results are not acceptable, the analysis process has to
 be repeated several times, until the goal is achieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern 3G radio networks are large and many of their key parameters are
 interdependent.
 Since an engineer is not able to cope with the level of complexity present
 in such systems, the computer, along with specialized software, guides
 the engineer to the most appropriate configuration for the network.
 In the context of this work, we will refer to this process as optimization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A common limitation of the implementations of such optimization methods,
 generally targeting traditional computer architectures of sequential execution,
 is their inability to meet the requirements needed by real-world mobile
 networks, since their computational-time complexity make them unfeasible
 for practical use.
 When analyzing big real-world networks with thousands of users it is necessary
 to reduce the execution time of the optimization processes as much as possible,
 so that they are useful for practical use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, the implementation of the framework will benefit from valuable
 advances in computer science and High Performance Computing (HPC), in order
 to perform faster and more reliable simulations

\begin_layout Standard
The complexity of these systems has grown even faster than their throughput
 capacity, thus making it impossible to plan 3G mobile networks with traditional
 methods.
 In this sense, an examination of colored coverage maps in conjunction with
 some statistical analysis are no longer appropriate tools for network examinati
on.
 Once a mobile network is launched, an important part of its operation and
 maintenance is monitoring of quality characteristics and changing parameter
 values in order to improve performance.
 In this sense, we may divide these tasks in two phases: analysis and decision
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nawrocki2006understanding"

\end_inset

.
 The analysis phase consists of network performance analysis, which mainly
 focuses on definition and collection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
 KPIs are quantifiable measurements, agreed to beforehand, that reflect,
 in this context, network quality factors.
 The second phase deals with making decisions, based on analytical results
 collected in the previous phase, about the configuration of particular
 parameter settings.
 This process (shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Optimization-cycle"

\end_inset

) is repeated until the achieved results are acceptable.

Optimization of 3G mobile networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although wireless networks are increasingly more sophisticated, the need
 for optimization work is still far from declining.
 It has been established that most 3G radio network optimization problems
 are NP-hard, since computational time grows non-polynomially with the increase
 of the problem size 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Moreover, there are other reasons directly related with the evolution of
 already deployed networks that greatly increase the need for optimization
 methods, as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 infrastructure, leaving room for parameter optimization only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Changes in usersâ€™ profile: the introduction of new services puts additional
 stress on the infrastructure, requiring additional optimization efforts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Changing propagation conditions: the allocation of a higher frequency band
 for UMTS compared to GSM requires deployment of more 3G sites than in 2G
 networks, mostly in urban areas, thus increasing inter-cell interference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this sense, network operators have shown the need to define different
 optimization targets.
 These targets are formed by an objective function that maps possible values
 of configuration parameters into a value.
 Thus, each element (solution) of the solution space is assigned a comparable
 value, i.e.
 a real number.
 This number represents a quality rating of the proposed solution and it
 is used to compare different solutions among each other, and ultimately
 select the best one.
 Unfortunately, there is no definitive objective function in the field of
 3G network optimization 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 However, it is possible to optimize for different targets such as coverage,
 base station location, etc.

 The problem formulation is based on a set of candidate sites where the

 Some years later, the same authors

 In both works, they propose a mixed integer programming model with which
 they aim to maximize the trade-off between total traffic covered and total
 installation costs.
 The only difference between the models is the constraint definition of
 the linear program, where the constraints in

\begin_layout Section
Optimizing antenna parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many antenna parameters that control the coverage and interference
 in the network, since the antenna shapes the emitted energy.
 Two important parameters are the azimuth angle and the elevation angle
 (or tilt) of the antenna.
 The antenna azimuth (shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Antenna-azimuth"

\end_inset

) is the direction in which the main beam of the horizontal pattern points
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "WCDMAforUMTS_RadioAccessForThirdGenerationMobileCommunications"

\end_inset

.
 The antenna tilt (shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Antenna-tilt"

\end_inset

) is defined as the angle of the main beam of the antenna relative to the
 horizontal plane 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "WCDMAforUMTS_RadioAccessForThirdGenerationMobileCommunications"

\end_inset

.
 Both of these parameters have a great influence on network quality, although
 antenna tilt requires less effort to implement, since most modern radio
 networks already support remote electrical tilt.
 The adjustment of these two parameters optimize some important aspects
 of the network, namely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
path loss between the base station and the mobile phone, since less power
 is required for a connection, hence more power is available for traffic;
 and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
interference between neighboring cells, which leads to an overall capacity
 increase.

 one and the outer one.
 The inner loop concentrates on frequency planning while the outer loop
 focuses on finding the optimal setting of antenna azimuth and tilt for
 the current solution delivered by the inner loop.
 Although frequency planning is not directly related to 3G network optimization,
 we found this approach interesting enough to make a reference to it.
 The inner loop could be easily replaced with some other optimization target,

 Whenever a mobile phone is switched on, it tries to register with the cell

 It also defines the effective coverage area of the cell: according to the
 the CPICH power level, the cell coverage area will enlarge or shrink.
 Consequently, by appropriately adjusting the CPICH power at the base stations,
 the number of served users per cell can be balanced among neighboring cells.
 This procedure is called load balancing and it reduces interference, stabilizes
 network operation, and facilitates radio resource management

Optimizing CPICH and antenna parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the antenna tilt and azimuth directly affect the direction and range
 in which the cell broadcasts its CPICH.
 Consequently, optimal CPICH power is highly dependent on how the antenna
 tilt and azimuth are configured at base stations.
 Ideal configuration of antenna tilt and azimuth network-wise, with the
 objective of optimizing the CPICH power consumption, is a challenging task.
 For this reason, many authors have considered optimization methods that

 Thus, the expression

The area being optimized is usually divided in squares (or pixels) of a
 certain size, which may vary from 10 to 100 meters, creating a grid of
 a certain resolution.
 A square is considered covered, if the signal to noise ratio is above a
 given threshold

 The control algorithm applies total transmission power measurements from
 the base station, neighboring cells and mobile terminals to determine the
 pilot qualification.
 The CPICH power is then periodically updated based on a group of heuristic

 A similar approach is described by Parkinnen et al.

Discussion

\begin_layout Standard
In the field of 3G network optimization, comparing the efficiency of different
 optimization methods has proven to be a very difficult task.
 There are several reasons for this, among which we have identified the
 following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The networks on which the experiments are carried out are not standardized.
 Thus, it is problematic to set up an environment in which the presented
 results may be reproduced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are no

 implementations of 3G mobile network simulators.
 On the contrary, there is a vast variety of proprietary (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

closed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) network simulators that only increase the ambiguity regarding the experimental
 environment used for a certain network layout and configuration.
 Moreover, some of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

closed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 network simulators do not even account on the built-in path loss estimation
 methods used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Only a small part of the referenced optimization methods perform their experimen
ts on real-life networks, that have been already deployed and are currently
 running.
 This fact creates a gap between the research field and the industry (i.e.
 the application area) and it is counterproductive for both the researchers
 and the network operators, since they don't benefit from mutual collaboration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that the creation of a standardized framework would be a great
 benefit in the field of 3G network optimization, as it would allow researchers
 to compare different methods, results and solutions in an easy, fast and
 objective manner.
 An effort in this direction is the MOMENTUM project 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Momentum.project"

\end_inset

.
 It was created with the objective of setting up a standardized experimental
 environment that would facilitate research cooperation and would ultimately
 benefit from an improvement on the research field of 3G networks.
 The project includes complete data about the terrain, properties of the
 service area and hardware used in three different mobile networks.
 It offers the researcher detailed information about real-life networks
 based in Berlin, Lisbon and The Hague.
 As part of the package, there is also a Java application programming interface
 (API) that eases the implementation of some conventional tasks such as
 data parsing.
 The main focus of project is on data, thus there is no network simulator
 included.
 In any case, the researcher benefits from several included traffic snapshots
 that help assessing different network configuration settings.
 There have been no updates in the MOMENTUM project since 2005, when the
 last data corrections were introduced

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of this survey and after reviewing many different papers
 on 3G network optimization, we can say that the MOMENTUM project has not
 been widely adopted by the scientific community.
 Moreover, several of the reviewed works do not offer detailed instructions
 on how to resemble the experimental environment.
 Consequently, it is very complicated (if not even impossible) to reproduce
 the presented results.
 Therefore, the selection of optimization methods, based on the results
 presented by their corresponding authors, is virtually meaningless, since
 the results are not comparable with each other.
 For this reason, we have decided to concentrate the following discussion
 on the optimization methods used, leaving the results aside.

The reproducibility problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A quick review of the state-of-the-art in 3G network optimization indicates
 that software, providing good computational models, is a very expensive
 tool for science.
 Moreover, since the vast majority of this software is proprietary, it relies
 on closed source, formats and protocols, which disclosure is explicitly
 forbidden by their licenses.
 This fact creates a big hurdle to one of the key phases of scientific methodolo

Discussion about the presented methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the optimizations methods presented in previous chapters, three
 distinctive groups emerge: genetic algorithms, linear programming and other
 search methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Genetic
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

algorithms These algorithms work on a population of solutions that allows
 a more comprehensive search for optimal solutions.
 As a direct consequence, an increase in running time is commonly observed.
 The implementation effort of genetic algorithms is to some degree higher
 than for simpler search methods (e.g.
 local search), but their inherent structure greatly simplifies possible
 parallel implementations and execution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Linear
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

programming Linear optimization problems are widely used in different optimizati
on areas and there are many good software packages to solve such problems.
 Consequently, if a problem can be modeled as a continuous linear problem,
 there is usually no difficulty in finding optimality.
 In the context of this survey, linear programming has proven useful for
 coverage optimization in early network planning stages.

 usually represent a compromise between running time and quality of results.
 They rely on evaluating a great number of alternative configurations.
 The number of parameters taken into account, as well as the evaluation
 precision, directly influence their running time.
 These methods don't excel in full simulation scenarios.
 On the other hand, some search methods (e.g.
 tabu search) have powerful mechanisms to escape local minima.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variety of optimization problems that have been introduced in the previous
 sections differ in many aspects like implementation, running time and solution
 quality.
 Picking the right method for a given situation depends on the optimization
 task and the desired results.
 Since computation time is usually an important restriction, simpler and
 faster methods may be preferable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beside the convenience of a survey such as the one presented in this work,
 it is very important to develop a feeling for the properties, advantages
 and drawbacks of the respective methods.
 Moreover, radio expert's recommendations regarding solution interpretation
 and feedback from everyday network operation, are an essential input for
 creating quality optimization methods.
 In this sense, and based on our own experience, the expert's advice is
 irreplaceable and a most valuable contribution to the research work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, as it may be observed in some of the presented references, it is often
 advisable to combine different methods.
 Therefore, a simple optimization method may find a subset of reasonable
 parameter configuration, whereas a more complex method could be applied
 afterward, to refine the search.
 Sometimes it may also be useful to apply a simple search method at the
 end to find better solutions in the vicinity of a current promising one.
