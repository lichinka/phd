\begin_layout Section
Optimization models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optimization may be informally defined as the procedure of finding better
 solutions to a given problem, which usually model some physical phenomenon.
 In our every day life, we are constantly solving small optimization problems,
 like choosing the shortest route to a friend's house, or organizing the
 appointments in our agenda.
 In general, these problems are small enough for us to find a good solution
 without extra help, but as they become larger and more complex, the aid
 of computers for their resolution is unavoidable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Complex multidimensional optimization problems are popular in engineering,
 economics, physics and other scientific fields.
 When solving an optimization problem, the objective is to find a

\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solution in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reasonable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 computational time.
 In this respect, the field of mathematical optimization has received a
 lot of attention by the scientific community during the last decades.
 However, both 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reasonable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are problem, application and context-specific concepts, in which the biggest
 challenge of selecting an appropiate optimization approach usually lays.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematical optimization involves the process of finding solutions from
 a group of possible decisions, which may be defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\min f(\vec{x})\qquad\vec{x}\in\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n},
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}=(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})$
\end_inset

 is a vector representing the decision variables, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

 is the objective function measuring the quality of the decisions and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is the set of feasible solutions of the problem, also known as search space.
 Note that the objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 makes it possible to define a total order relation between any pair of
 solutions in the search space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The search space 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 may also be expressed as a solution to a system of equalities or inequialities,
 e.g.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
g(x_{1},\dots,x_{n}) & \leq & 0\nonumber \\
h(x_{1},\dots,x_{n}) & = & 0
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optimization problems involving the maximization of the objective function
 also fall into this category, since:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\max f(\vec{x})=-\min(-f(\vec{x}))\label{eq:02-maximization_minization_problem_relation}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A point 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is considered to be an unrestricted local minimum of a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 if it holds a better value than all its neightbours, i.e.
 there exits 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

 so that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(\vec{x}^{*})\le f(\vec{x})\qquad\forall\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\qquad\mid\vec{x}-\vec{x}^{*}\mid<\epsilon\label{eq:02-local_minimum}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Similarly, a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is considered to be an unrestricted global minimum of a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 if it holds a better value than all others, i.e.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
f(\vec{x}^{*})\leq f(\vec{x})\qquad\forall\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\label{eq:02-global_minimum}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concepts of local and global minimum are considered strict if the inequaliti
es of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:02-local_minimum"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:02-global_minimum"

\end_inset

 are strict.
 Likewise, the definition of local and global maximum is given by the existing
 relation between a minimization and a maximization problem, as specified
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:02-maximization_minization_problem_relation"

\end_inset

, i.e.
 a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a local or global maximum of a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a local or global minimum of function 
\begin_inset Formula $-f$
\end_inset

, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Gradient-based methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gradient-based methods are among the oldest and most studied optimization
 approaches.
 They are based on the derivative of the optimized function, using the first
 and even the second derivate of a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 The name gradient follows from the derivative of multidimensional functions,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla f(\vec{x})$
\end_inset

, which is simply a vector where each element is the slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 in that dimension, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $<\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{1}},\dots,\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{n}}>$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Luke-Essentials_of_metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principle behind gradient-based methods is rather simple.
 Starting from an arbitrary value for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, we iteratevily substract (or add) a small positive value to it, e.g.
 for gradient descent:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x\leftarrow x-\alpha f'(x),
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is a small positive value.
 Consequently, a positive slope will make 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 decrease, whereas a negative slope will make it increase.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:02-gradient_descent"

\end_inset

 shows an example of this behaviour.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 will gradually move down the function until it finds its minimum, where
 
\begin_inset Formula $f'(x)$
\end_inset

 is zero, causing it to stop.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, gradient methods have certaing drawbacks that make them unsuitable
 for tackling a wide range of optimization problems.
 Take, for example, the time they take to converge.
 As gradient descent approaches a function minimum, it will skip this point
 and land on the other side.
 In the next step, something similar will happen, but this time from the
 other side of the minimum point, thus slowly approaching to the target
 in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

zig-zag
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 way.
 This behavior is directly related to the slope of the function at the given
 point, i.e.
 a steepest slope translates into a larger jump, and may be allivieatted
 by adjusting the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 However, some functions (or regions of functions) may require smaller values,
 while for others a bigger value would be more appropiate.
 Newton's method improves this by taking the second derivative of the function
 into account, i.e.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x\leftarrow x-\alpha\frac{f'(x)}{f''(x)},
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
thus adjusting the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 as it converges towards a point with zero slope 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Luke-Essentials_of_metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another issue is how other points are handled.
 Beside maxima and minima points, some functions also contain saddle points
 (known as inflection points in one-dimensional functions).
 Clearly, the first derivative of a saddle point is zero, meaning gradient
 descent will stop looking for the minimum, even though it hasn't found
 it (see Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:02-gradient_descent_saddle_point"

\end_inset

).
 Newton's method, on the other hand, does not help either.
 Moreover, in this case, we would be even dividing by zero! These observations
 clearly show how gradient methods get caught in local optima.
 We define local optima of a function as the optima (or minima in our case)
 of a local region.
 Similarly, global optima are defined as the optima of the whole domain
 of a function.
 It follows that gradient methods, as gradient descent or Newton’s method,
 are local optimization algorithms

\begin_layout Standard
But maybe the biggest concern with gradient-based methods is they assume
 the function under optimization is derivable.
 This assumption holds only when optimizing a well-formed mathematical function.
 Unfortunately, this is generally not the case, since in most cases the
 gradient is not computable because the function is not known.
 The only available approach in such situations is creating inputs to the
 function in order to assess their quality.
 Metaheuristics are good candidates for this class of problems to solve
 moderate and large instances.

\begin_layout Subsection
Linear and non-linear programming
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was in the early 40s of the twentieth century, through the work of teams
 formed by mathematicians, economists and physicists, that the basis were
 established for the resolution of problems with a set of techniques known
 as linear and non-linear programming.
 Their initial goal was to solve different kinds of logistic problems during
 the second world war.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a linear programming optimization problem, both the objective function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and a given set of constraints are linear functions.
 The constraints impose restrictions over 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 they must meet certain requirements as, for example, fullfil a limited
 availability of resources.
 An problem may be formulated as follows, e.g.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\min f(\vec{x})=c\cdot\vec{x}\label{eq:02-linear_programming_objective_function}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
subject to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
A\cdot\vec{x} & \le & b\label{eq:02-linear_programming_constraints}\\
\vec{x} & \ge & \vec{0}\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
In the example above, the inequalities defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:02-linear_programming_constraints"

\end_inset

 are the constraints to the linear program defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:02-linear_programming_objective_function"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For solving continous linear optimization problems, efficient exact algorithms
 exist, such as the simplex method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dantzig-Maximization_of_a_linear_function_of_variables_subject_to_linear_inequalities:1951"

\end_inset

 or the interior-points method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Karmarkar-A_new_polynomial_time_algorithm_for_linear_programming:1984"

\end_inset

.
 Indeed, linear programming is one of the most satisfactory models of solving
 optimization problems, since the feasible region of the problem is a convex
 set and the objective function is a convex function.
 It follows that the global optimum is a node of the polytope representing
 the feasible region 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Non-linear programming models, on the other hand, consider problems where
 the objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and/or the constraints are non-linear 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bazaraa-Nonlinear_programming:2006"

\end_inset

.
 However, non-linear continuous problems are more difficult to solve.
 Despite several existing technique to linearize such models, they often
 not only introduce extra variables and constraints, but also some degree
 of approximation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Glover-Improved_linear_programming_formulations_for_nonlinear_problems:1975"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, some problem properties such as high dimensionality, parameter
 interaction, and multi-modality make these approaches ineffective.

Generally, when dealing with real-world problems, the availability of analytical
 optimization models, such as required by gradient methods or (non-)linear
 programming, is not guaranteed.
 Indeed, for some applications, only simulations or physical models are
 the available means for objective-function evaluation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, represent a group of approximation algorithms designed to combine basic
 heuristic principles with advanced high-level guidance methods, targeted
 at improving the efficiency of a search process.
 These techniques are meant to find good solutions to a given problem, for
 which the mathematical function is not available or its search space is
 big enough for an exhaustive search to be unfeasible

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the theorical point of view, metaheuristics represent a subset of stochasti
c optimization, since they use some degree of randomness to find optimal
 (or as optimal as possible) solutions to hard problems.
 They are the most general of these kinds of algorithms, and are applied
 to a wide range of problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Luke-Essentials_of_metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

.
 Unlike the exact optimization methods introduced in the previous sections,
 metaheuristics do not guarantee the optimality of the obtained solutions
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Talbi_Metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

.
 Moreover, they do not define how close the obtained solutions are from
 the optimal ones, as approximation algorithms do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characterization given by Blum and Roli 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Blum-Metaheuristics_in_combinatorial_optimization_overview_and_coconceptual_comparison:2003"

\end_inset

 provides a clear overview of the fundamental properties associated with
 metaheuristics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
metaheuristics are strategies that “guide” the search process;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
their goal is to efficiently explore the search space in order to find optimal
 or near-optimal solutions;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they build upon techniques which range from simple local search procedures
 to complex learning processes;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they are approximate and usually non-deterministic;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they may incorporate mechanisms to avoid getting trapped in confined areas
 of the search space;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
their basic concepts permit an abstract-level description, which is not
 problem-specific;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
they may make use of domain-specific knowledge in the form of heuristics
 that are controlled by the upper level strategy;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
advanced metaheuristics use search experience (implemented as some form
 of memory) to guide the search process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strategies used by metaheuristics should provide a dynamic balance between
 the exploitation of the accumulated search experience (commonly called
 intensification) and the exploration of the search space (commonly called
 diversification) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Blum-Metaheuristics_in_combinatorial_optimization_overview_and_coconceptual_comparison:2003"

\end_inset

.
 This balance provides the necessary means to quickly identify promising
 regions, and early discarding those which have already been explored or
 don't provide solutions of better quality.
 Promising regions within the search space, which are identified by the
 obtained 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solutions, are thoughfully explored during the intensification phase, hoping
 to find better solutions.
 On the other hand, during the diversification phase, not yet visited regions
 are explored, making sure the search space as a whole is evenly explored,
 thus avoid confining the search to a reduced number of regions.
 In this context, the ultimate search algorithm in terms of diversification
 is random search.
 Random search generates a random solution in the search space at each iteration
, without using memory 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Talbi_Metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

.
 In terms of intensification, iterative local search is a representative
 algorithm.
 The steepest local search algorithm selects, at each iteration, the best
 neighboring solution that improves the current one 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metaheuristics are applicable where state-of-the-art exact algorithms cannot
 tackle the given instances within the required time, either because of
 the size or the structure of the given problem instances.
 The meaning of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

required time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 within this context directly depends on the target optimization problem
 itself.
 A feasible or acceptable time may vary from some seconds to several months,
 again, depending on the target optimization problem, e.g.
 real-time decisions against structural-design problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the characterization given by Talbi 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Talbi-Metaheuristics_from_design_to_implementation:2009"

\end_inset

, let us summarize the essential properties of optimization problems that
 justify the use of metaheuristics:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Very large problem instances.
 Even though exact polynomial-time algorithms might be known for solving
 the target problem, they are too expensive due to the size of instances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Problems with hard real-time constraints, where a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good solution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has to be found online.
 Metaheuristics appear as an alternative to exact algorithms in order to
 reduce the search time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A difficult problem of moderate size, which input instances have an intrincate
 structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Optimization problems with time-consuming objective function(s) and/or constrain
ts.
 Indeed, various real-world optimization problems are characterized by the
 huge computational cost of the objective functions.
 Several radio-network design problems fall into this category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Problems that cannot be solved with exhaustive search due to the non-analytical
 models on which they are based.
 These problems are defined by a black-box evaluation of the objective function
 (see next section).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The influence of these conditions may increase in the presence of non-determinis
tic optimization models, e.g.
 problems with complex Monte Carlo simulations 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Creutz-Microcanonincal_monte_carlo_simulation:1983"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Undoubtedly, metaheuristics are rapidly gaining popularity as optimization
 problems are increasing in both size and complexity.
 Indeed, as the computing power of commodity hardware increases, the possibility
 of building models of greater complexity is available for developing more
 accurate models of real-world problems in engineering and science.

.
 If there exists a polynomial-time algorithm to solve a problem, we say
 the problem is easy or tractable.
 Similarly, if a problem is difficult or intractable, there is no known
 polynomial-time algorithm to solve it.
 
\end_layout

Many optimization problems cannot be formulated with a clear analytical
 mathematical notation.
 In such cases, the objective function may become a black box

 This is one of the main advantages when using metaheuristics, i.e.
 there is no need of a complete knowledge of the targeted model.
 Indeed, in a black box optimization, no analytical formulation of the objective
 exists

Typically, the experiments associated with these kind of problems are very
 expensive in terms of time and cost, since a simulation must be forced
 to evaluate the solution.
 Generally speaking, the most time-consuming part of a metaheuristic optimizatio
n process is the evaluation of the objective function 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Talbi_Metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

.
 This is especially true when dealing with real-world problems of areas
 such as structural design

 A possible subtitution for lenghty evaluations is to reduce their complexity
 by approximating the objective function, thus replacing the it with an
 approximation during the optimization process.
 This approach is known as meta-modeling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Talbi_Metaheuristics:2009"

\end_inset

.
 However, when dealing with approximations, some degree of solution quality
 is inevitably sacrified.
 As we will show in the following chapters, there is a very fine balance
 between the number of evaluations and the quality of the achieved solutions.
 Consequently, reducing the time spent in objective-function evaluation
 should favorably influence the solution quality achieved by a preferred
 metaheuristic algorithm.
 A major portion of this thesis is dedicated to improve this specific aspect
 on the area of radio-network optimization.

In practice, black-box evaluation of the objective function presents an
 inherent problem.
 In the context of research works related to radio-network optimization,
 there is an increasingly habit of not providing the black-box used to evaluate
 a given approach, and that leads to the results provided.
 A quick review of the state-of-the-art in radio-network optimization indicates
 that this fact has become increasingly regular in several published works
 [refs???].
 This fact creates a barrier to one of the most important phases of scientific
 methodology: experimental reproducibility

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several reasons why the situation has reached this point.
 It is a known fact that proprierary software, providing good computational
 models for radio-network simulation, is a very expensive tool for science.
 Even neglecting the economical aspect, but considering the great variety
 of software packages and license combinations, it is practically impossible
 for a research laboratory to have at its disposal the whole pallete of
 commercially-available solutions.
 Moreover, genuine users of these applications are generally not allowed
 to mention the formats, protocols, or algorithms used by the proprietary
 software, since their disclosure is explicitly forbidden by the commercial
 licenses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we turn our attention to non-commercial and open-source packages for
 radio-network simulation [refs!???], we would quickly run into mainly two
 difficulties: poor documentation and low scalability.
 The scalability issues shown by some projects [refs!???] retrain the packages
 to be used in real-world environments, where big problem instances are
 the rule.
 Despite this, it is a huge merit and acknowledgement to the authors of
 this packages, not only for providing it to the scientific community, including
 their source code, but fundamentaly because providing an environment in
 which different kinds of simulations are completely reproducible.
 Regarding the lack of documentation, it represents a big hurdle when extending
 the base code, which becomes a difficult taskj without the help of the
 original authors of the package, who have a deep knowlegge of the code-base.
 This knowledge is required in order to effectivelly expand the functionality
 of the open-source tool in question.
 This is especially true when dealing with complex simulation frameworks,
 as the ones used for radio networks.

\begin_layout Subsection
Metaheuristic algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Related literature groups metaheuristic algorithms due to their behaviour.
 For example, the following is a list of fundamentally different optimization
 algorithms, namely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
differential evolution, from the family of evolutionary algorithms;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
differential ant-stigmergy algorithm, from the family of swarm-intelligence
 algorithms; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
simulated annealing, from the group of classic metaheuristic algorithms,
 targeted at combinatorial optimization problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these algorithms shall minimize an objective-function value by adopting
 essentially disparate approaches, hence the diversity of applying algorithms
 belonging to different families to solve the same optimization problem.
 In this way we want to find out whether any of the presented approaches
 is better suited for solving our problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following sections we give a short introduction about their functioning
 and controlling parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differential evolution (DE) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "storn1997_Differential_evolution"

\end_inset

 is a simple and powerful evolutionary algorithm proposed for global optimizatio
n.
 A wide range of optimization problems have been solved by applying DE 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "das2010_differential_evolution_state_of_the_art"

\end_inset

.
 The algorithm exhibits a parallel direct search method, which utilizes
 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

-dimensional parameter vectors.
 The balancing problem is expressed in each component of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 of the population, which maps to the CPICH power of one cell under optimization
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{aG}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots x_{i},\ldots,x_{D}\right\} ,\label{eq:DE_mapping-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\in P_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents a candidate CPICH power setting of cell 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 indicates the generation of an individual 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in the population.
 Since there are 
\begin_inset Formula $|N|$
\end_inset

 cells in the mobile network, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $D=|N|$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In each generation, DE produces new parameter vectors by adding the weighted
 difference between two population vectors to a third one 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "storn1997_Differential_evolution"

\end_inset

.
 The resulting vector is retained if it yields a lower objective function
 value than a predetermined population member; otherwise, the old vector
 is kept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are different variants of DE.
 We have chosen the most popular one to solve our optimization problem,
 called 
\emph on
DE/rand/1/bin
\emph default
.
 The nomenclature used to name this variant indicates the way the algorithm
 works:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
DE 
\emph default
denotes the differential evolution algorithm,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
rand 
\emph default
indicates that the individuals selected to compute the mutation values are
 randomly chosen,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1
\emph on
 
\emph default
specifies the number of pairs of selected solutions used to calculate the
 weighted difference vector, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
bin 
\emph default
means that a binomial recombination operator is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We considered four parameters to control the search process of DE: the populatio
n size, the maximum number of generations for the algorithm to run, the
 crossover constant, and the mutation scaling factor.

Based on the metaheuristic Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the differential ant-stigmergy algorithm (DASA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "korosec2010_DASA"

\end_inset

 provides a framework to successfully cope with high-dimensional numerical
 optimization problems.
 It creates a fine-grained discrete form of the search space, representing
 it as a graph.
 This graph is then used as the walking paths for the ants, which iteratively
 improve the temporary best solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mapping between the balancing problem and DASA is similar to the one
 depicted in Equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{a}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots x_{i},\ldots,x_{D}\right\} \label{eq:DASA_mapping-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, each ant, 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, creates its own solution vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{a}$
\end_inset

, during the minimization process.
 At the end of every iteration, and after all the ants have created solutions,
 they are evaluated to establish if any of them is better than the best
 solution found so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are six parameters that control the way DASA explores the search space:
 the number of ants, the discrete base, the pheromone dispersion factor,
 the global scale-increasing factor, the global scale-decreasing factor,
 and the maximum parameter precision.
\end_layout

As the third optimization algorithm to tackle the balancing problem we have
 chosen simulated annealing (SA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, a classic metaheuristic algorithm often used when the search space is
 discrete.
 SA has proved to be a solid optimization algorithm, capable of giving high-qual
ity solutions to a wide scope of optimization problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At each time step during the process, the system under optimization is in
 a given 
\emph on
state
\emph default
.
 The objective function maps a system state to a value known as the 
\emph on
energy
\emph default
 of the system in that state.
 A 
\emph on
move
\emph default
 in the search space represents a change in the state of the system.
 After making a move, the system may exhibit lower or higher energy, depending
 on the results of the objective function.
 When dealing with minimization problems, a better state always describes
 lower energy than the previous one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SA incorporates the notion of 
\emph on
temperature
\emph default
, by which the probability of moving the current state of the system into
 a worst one is lowered as the temperature decreases.
 Exploration of the search space is thus induced at higher temperature,
 whereas exploitation appears at lower temperature, when only improving
 moves are accepted.

Optimization of radio networks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a radio network is launched, an important part of its operation and
 maintenance deals with monitoring its quality characteristics and making
 changes in the configuration of the deployed equipment and parameter values
 in order to improve its overall performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The evolution from 3G to 4G has introduced not only the technology needed
 to increase data capacity and voice quality, but also a greater complexity
 in terms of network planning, deployment, and configuration, which have
 rendered some of the traditionally used methods to be ineffective.
 In a traditional approach (i.e.
 manual), during the network planning and maintenance processes, a radio-network
 simulation software executes the analysis, while an engineer makes the
 change decisions.
 Therefore, a radio-planning engineer adapts the network parameters manually
 and the network-planning tool analyzes the given configuration.
 If the obtained results are not acceptable, the analysis process has to
 be repeated several times, until a given goal is achieved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complexity of radio-network has grown even faster than their throughput
 capacity, thus making it impossible to plan 4G radio networks with traditional
 methods.
 In this sense, an examination of colored coverage maps in conjunction with
 some statistical analysis are no longer appropriate tools for troubleshooting
 a network.
 Moreover, since real-world 4G radio networks are large and many of their
 configuration parameters are interdependent, an engineer is not able to
 cope with the level of complexity present in such systems.
 For that reason, the computer, along with specialized software, guides
 the engineer to the most appropriate configuration for the network.
 In the context of this work, we will refer to this process as radio-network
 optimization.
\end_layout

Radio-network optimization may be divided into two fundamental phases: analysis
 and decision 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The analysis phase consists on the examination of network performance,
 which mainly focuses on the definition and collection of several Key Performanc
e Indicators (KPIs).
 KPIs are quantifiable measurements, agreed to beforehand, that reflect
 network quality factors.
 The second phase deals with the decision making, based on the analytical
 results collected in the previous phase, about the configuration of a particula
r configuration or parameter setting.

A common limitation of several optimization methods appearing in the literature
 [ref!???] is their inability to meet the requirements needed by real-world
 radio networks, since their computational-time complexity make them unfeasible
 for practical use in industrial-sized scenarios.
 Particularly, this limitation is more common in implementations targeting
 traditional computer architectures of sequential execution [ref!???].
 When analyzing real-world radio networks with thousands of transmitters
 it is necessary to reduce the execution time of the optimization processes,
 so that they are useful for practical use.

In this context, network operators define different optimization targets,
 depending on the addressed optimization problem.
 These targets are formed by an objective function that maps possible configurat
ions into a real value.
 This number represents a quality rating of the proposed solution and it
 is used to compare different solutions among each other, and ultimately
 select the best one.
 Unfortunately, there is no definitive objective function in the field of

 The coverage problem is defined by considering the signal level in every

 is above a fixed threshold.

A different formulation considers the site selection problem as a 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-median problem, in which base station location is the only decision variable
 considered.
 To each of the candidates solutions, an installation cost is also associated.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-median problem constitutes seeking 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 different locations each time, regardless of how distant the sites are.
 The problem is to select one candidate site from each region to install
 a base station such that the traffic capacity and the size of the covered
 area are maximized with the lowest installation cost.

 offer a discussion about the computational results of two different heuristics:
 greedy search and tabu search.
 The problem formulation is based on a set of candidate sites where the
 base stations can be installed, an estimation of the traffic distribution
 and a propagation description of the area to be covered.
 Some years later, the same authors

 extended the problem formulation by also considering base station configuration
 and hardware characteristics.
 In both works, they propose a mixed integer programming model with which
 they aim to maximize the trade-off between total traffic covered and total
 installation costs.
 The only difference between the models is the constraint definition of
 the linear program, where the constraints in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Subsection
Optimizing antenna parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many antenna parameters that control the coverage and interference
 in the network, since the antenna shapes the emitted energy.
 Two important parameters are the azimuth angle and the elevation angle
 (or tilt) of the antenna.
 The antenna azimuth (shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Antenna-azimuth"

\end_inset

) is the direction in which the main beam of the horizontal pattern points
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "WCDMAforUMTS_RadioAccessForThirdGenerationMobileCommunications"

\end_inset

.
 The antenna tilt (shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Antenna-tilt"

\end_inset

) is defined as the angle of the main beam of the antenna relative to the
 horizontal plane 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "WCDMAforUMTS_RadioAccessForThirdGenerationMobileCommunications"

\end_inset

.
 Both of these parameters have a great influence on network quality, although
 antenna tilt requires less effort to implement, since most modern radio
 networks already support remote electrical tilt.
 The adjustment of these two parameters optimize some important aspects
 of the network, namely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
path loss between the base station and the mobile phone, since less power
 is required for a connection, hence more power is available for traffic;
 and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
interference between neighboring cells, which leads to an overall capacity
 increase.

 present a method which is composed of two optimization loops: the inner
 one and the outer one.
 The inner loop concentrates on frequency planning while the outer loop
 focuses on finding the optimal setting of antenna azimuth and tilt for
 the current solution delivered by the inner loop.
 Although frequency planning is not directly related to 3G network optimization,
 we found this approach interesting enough to make a reference to it.
 The inner loop could be easily replaced with some other optimization target,
 e.g.
 common pilot channel power setting.

 Whenever a mobile phone is switched on, it tries to register with the cell
 providing the highest received CPICH level.
 It also defines the effective coverage area of the cell: according to the
 the CPICH power level, the cell coverage area will enlarge or shrink.
 Consequently, by appropriately adjusting the CPICH power at the base stations,
 the number of served users per cell can be balanced among neighboring cells.
 This procedure is called load balancing and it reduces interference, stabilizes
 network operation, and facilitates radio resource management

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Optimizing CPICH and antenna parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the antenna tilt and azimuth directly affect the direction and range
 in which the cell broadcasts its CPICH.
 Consequently, optimal CPICH power is highly dependent on how the antenna
 tilt and azimuth are configured at base stations.
 Ideal configuration of antenna tilt and azimuth network-wise, with the
 objective of optimizing the CPICH power consumption, is a challenging task.
 For this reason, many authors have considered optimization methods that
 address all three parameters.

 network optimization.

 Thus, the expression

 coverage.
 This value ranges from 0 (no coverage) to 1 (total coverage).

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the field of 3G network optimization, comparing the efficiency of different
 optimization methods has proven to be a very difficult task.
 There are several reasons for this, among which we have identified the
 following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The networks on which the experiments are carried out are not standardized.
 Thus, it is problematic to set up an environment in which the presented
 results may be reproduced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 implementations of 3G mobile network simulators.
 On the contrary, there is a vast variety of proprietary (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

closed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) network simulators that only increase the ambiguity regarding the experimental
 environment used for a certain network layout and configuration.
 Moreover, some of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

closed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 network simulators do not even account on the built-in path loss estimation
 methods used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Only a small part of the referenced optimization methods perform their experimen
ts on real-life networks, that have been already deployed and are currently
 running.
 This fact creates a gap between the research field and the industry (i.e.
 the application area) and it is counterproductive for both the researchers
 and the network operators, since they don't benefit from mutual collaboration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We believe that the creation of a standardized framework would be a great
 benefit in the field of 3G network optimization, as it would allow researchers
 to compare different methods, results and solutions in an easy, fast and
 objective manner.
 An effort in this direction is the MOMENTUM project 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Momentum.project"

\end_inset

.
 It was created with the objective of setting up a standardized experimental
 environment that would facilitate research cooperation and would ultimately
 benefit from an improvement on the research field of 3G networks.
 The project includes complete data about the terrain, properties of the
 service area and hardware used in three different mobile networks.
 It offers the researcher detailed information about real-life networks
 based in Berlin, Lisbon and The Hague.
 As part of the package, there is also a Java application programming interface
 (API) that eases the implementation of some conventional tasks such as
 data parsing.
 The main focus of project is on data, thus there is no network simulator
 included.
 In any case, the researcher benefits from several included traffic snapshots
 that help assessing different network configuration settings.
 There have been no updates in the MOMENTUM project since 2005, when the
 last data corrections were introduced 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the context of this survey and after reviewing many different papers
 on 3G network optimization, we can say that the MOMENTUM project has not
 been widely adopted by the scientific community.
 Moreover, several of the reviewed works do not offer detailed instructions
 on how to resemble the experimental environment.
 Consequently, it is very complicated (if not even impossible) to reproduce
 the presented results.
 Therefore, the selection of optimization methods, based on the results
 presented by their corresponding authors, is virtually meaningless, since
 the results are not comparable with each other.
 For this reason, we have decided to concentrate the following discussion
 on the optimization methods used, leaving the results aside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Discussion about the presented methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the optimizations methods presented in previous chapters, three
 distinctive groups emerge: genetic algorithms, linear programming and other
 search methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Genetic
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

algorithms These algorithms work on a population of solutions that allows
 a more comprehensive search for optimal solutions.
 As a direct consequence, an increase in running time is commonly observed.
 The implementation effort of genetic algorithms is to some degree higher
 than for simpler search methods (e.g.
 local search), but their inherent structure greatly simplifies possible
 parallel implementations and execution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Linear
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

programming Linear optimization problems are widely used in different optimizati
on areas and there are many good software packages to solve such problems.
 Consequently, if a problem can be modeled as a continuous linear problem,
 there is usually no difficulty in finding optimality.
 In the context of this survey, linear programming has proven useful for
 coverage optimization in early network planning stages.

 usually represent a compromise between running time and quality of results.
 They rely on evaluating a great number of alternative configurations.
 The number of parameters taken into account, as well as the evaluation
 precision, directly influence their running time.
 These methods don't excel in full simulation scenarios.
 On the other hand, some search methods (e.g.
 tabu search) have powerful mechanisms to escape local minima.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variety of optimization problems that have been introduced in the previous
 sections differ in many aspects like implementation, running time and solution
 quality.
 Picking the right method for a given situation depends on the optimization
 task and the desired results.
 Since computation time is usually an important restriction, simpler and
 faster methods may be preferable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beside the convenience of a survey such as the one presented in this work,
 it is very important to develop a feeling for the properties, advantages
 and drawbacks of the respective methods.
 Moreover, radio expert's recommendations regarding solution interpretation
 and feedback from everyday network operation, are an essential input for
 creating quality optimization methods.
 In this sense, and based on our own experience, the expert's advice is
 irreplaceable and a most valuable contribution to the research work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, as it may be observed in some of the presented references, it is often
 advisable to combine different methods.
 Therefore, a simple optimization method may find a subset of reasonable
 parameter configuration, whereas a more complex method could be applied
 afterward, to refine the search.
 Sometimes it may also be useful to apply a simple search method at the
 end to find better solutions in the vicinity of a current promising one.

In mobile networks, handover is one of the main features that allows user's
 mobility 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The concept behind the handover operation is simple: when a user moves
 from the coverage area of a cell to the coverage area of a neighboring
 cell, the system creates a new connection with the latter cell and disconnects
 the user from the former one, while keeping the current connection active.
 Soft-handover (SHO
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

\end_inset

), on the other hand, is a possibility available in mobile networks using
 the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
prefix "A"
symbol "WCDMA"
description "Wideband Code Division Multiple Access."

\end_inset

) technology, which the UMTS employs.
 SHO enhances handover functionality by allowing a user to potentially operate
 on multiple radio links in parallel.
 Since different users are separated by unique spreading codes, the detection
 of single user's signal is implemented by despreading with the same code
 sequence used in the transmitter

Every mobile terminal constantly monitors the common pilot power channel
 (CPICH

\end_inset

) of the connected cell and its neighbors.
 The information about these measurements is sent to the network by the
 user terminal (i.e.
 mobile).
 The SHO condition depends on the relative received signal quality from
 different cells and the SHO window, which triggers the addition of a cell
 to the user's active set.
 Depending on radio propagation characteristics and different transceiver
 capabilities, the radio transmission can gain more than 3 dB out of a SHO
 situation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WCDMAforUMTS_RadioAccessForThirdGenerationMobileCommunications"

\end_inset

.
 From this point of view, SHO is a method to reduce interference and improve
 radio quality, particularly at the cell border where radio coverage is
 of inferior quality.
 In UMTS Release 99 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "3GPP_R99"

\end_inset

, SHO is specified to work from the network towards the user (i.e.
 downlink), and from the user towards the network (i.e.
 uplink).

With the introduction of High Speed Packet Access (HSPA
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature

\end_inset

) as an improvement of the performance existing in WCDMA protocols, the
 role SHO plays in mobile network configuration and functioning slightly
 changed.
 The key difference is that High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
prefix "A"
symbol "HSDPA"

) does not support SHO, whereas the High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA

) does.
 This particular distinction is discussed in Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, since it has some key implications in the balanced distribution of SHO
 areas, and thus in the quality of HSPA services

 The capacity of a cell is limited by the amount of available power at the
 base station and the interference level at the mobile terminal.
 The coverage area of any cell is controlled by changing its pilot power,
 which consequently modifies the service area of the network.

 as the implementation platform of our optimization system on GPU.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OpenCL is an open parallel computing API designed to enable GPUs and other
 co-processors to work together with the CPU, providing additional computing
 power.
 As a standard, OpenCL 1.0 was released in 2008, by The Khronos Group, an
 independent standards consortium 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Munshi_The.OpenCL.specification:2009"

\end_inset

.
 For additional information about the OpenCL standard and API, we refer
 the reader to the numerous guides available online.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our choice in using OpenCL was greatly influenced by the fact that its bitcode
 runs on a variety of hardware, including multicore CPUs and GPUs from different
 vendors.
 This provides a complete framework capable of comparing execution speed-up
 on different hardware without the need of changing the implementation.
 
\end_layout

One unfortunate consequence of the vendor variety is that NVIDIA's CUDA
