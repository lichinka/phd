In Chapter

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, an application exploiting the advantages of faster evaluation methods
 has been presented.
 Solving the service-coverage problem for real-world networks capitalizes
 on the ability to tackle bigger problem instances.
 Because of their size, such problems were previously unsolvable in a feasible
 amount of time.
 This improved performance also allows solving optimization problems with
 a higher degree of complexity, usually represented by the evaluation of
 multi-dimensional, non-convex objective functions.

This chapter focuses on solving a new optimization problem for 3G networks
 that deals with downlink and uplink SHO areas (see Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:02-Handover-and-soft-handover"

\end_inset

).
 By introducing a penalty-based objective function and some hard constraints,
 the formal definition of the SHO-balancing problem in UMTS networks is
 given.
 The state-of-the-art mathematical model used and the penalty scores of
 the objective function are set according to the configuration and layout
 of a real mobile network, deployed in Slovenia by Telekom Slovenije, d.d.
 The balancing problem is then tackled by three optimization algorithms,
 each of them belonging to a different class of metaheuristic approaches.

To the best of the author's knowledge, there is no reference in the literature

\begin_layout Standard
Despite several built-in mechanisms that allow a radio network to overcome
 different problems due to the lack of SHO during a HSDPA connection, some
 abnormal cases do arise.
 This is especially important in areas where there is SHO capability in
 the uplink, but none in the downlink.
 An example of such case is depicted in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:07-Problem_illustration"

\end_inset

, which shows the interference behavior (denoted as UL RSSI) during a HSPA
 connection in: (a) normal SHO conditions, and (b) unbalanced SHO conditions.
 The plotted data are actual radio-network statistics from the mobile network
 deployed in Slovenia by Telekom Slovenije, d.d.
 The graph (a) shows a normal HSUPA-enabled service situation, in which
 the measured interference is proportional to the traffic being served.
 Note how the noise rises with the increased traffic on cell
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1, while its neighbor (cell
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2) has almost no interference nor traffic.
 Moreover, the graph profile for both traffic and noise of cell
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1 are almost identical.
 The graph (b) depicts a problematic situation, where the noise level does
 not only rise on the cell serving the HSUPA services (cell
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1), but also on the neighboring one.
 Notice how the interference level rises on the cell that has almost no
 traffic (cell
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2).
 It is clear that the source of this noise rise is generated by the active
 connection on cell
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1, which shows an increase in HSUPA traffic.
 However, the noise-level profile on cell
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2 does not follow its traffic, as it did in the normal situation (a).
 This is due to cell
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2 not being part of the active set.
 Such situations appear when the uplink coverage is larger than the downlink
 coverage.
 Interestingly enough, this seems to be an exceptional case, as Holma and
 Toskala write in
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, when describing the SHO in chapter 5:

 There is no obvious reason why the serving E-DCH cell would not be the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the described context, the challenge is to achieve the correct balance
 and distribution of downlink and uplink SHO areas within a working UMTS
 network.
 Therefore, the network has to be fine-tuned to improve the SHO-area balancing,
 in order to avoid the exceptional appearance of problematic situations,
 as shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 This clearly implies that the mobile network configuration should not be
 excessively altered, since other aspects of the network are working well
 before starting the optimization process.
 Hence, the objective of the optimization problem is to find a pilot-power
 configuration for all the cells in the target network, such that the balance
 of downlink and uplink SHO areas is improved and other network aspects
 are preserved.
 The optimization process takes into account different kinds of hardware,
 e.g., amplifiers, cables and antennas, while adjusting the pilot powers of
 the cells.

, considering, among other variables, BS locations and hardware.
 However, most mobile operators are unable to apply such methods to a live
 network, since the planning phase of the new installation has long been
 concluded.
 Moreover, the great majority of the BSs has already been deployed and their
 hardware also installed.
 Therefore, from the mobile operator's point of view, mainly parameter and
 software optimization are the tools available, when it comes to QoS improvement
 (see Chapter

 Such a wide spectrum of available procedures is directly related to the
 diverse criteria taken into account when assigning the pilot power of a
 cell.
 The fundamental reason behind this fact is that the pilot power is a common
 adjustment variable of various optimization problems in radio networks.
 This is especially true for UMTS networks, due to their frequency-reuse
 factor of one

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

dB (relative to the pilot-power setting the cell had before optimization),
 the number of elements in the set 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

 A smaller value for the change step would have practically no influence
 over the transmit-power adaptation of the cells, whereas bigger changes
 would suffer from excessive granularity.
 These reasons were discussed and confirmed by the radio engineers at Telekom
 Slovenije, d.d.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the optimization point of view, the purpose of the change step is twofold.
 First, since the optimization targets a live network, there is no need
 for the algorithms to create complete new configurations, but just to fine-tune
 the existing ones.
 Second, the problem complexity is lowered, because the size of the search
 space is smaller and discrete.

 It follows that the cells to which a UE

 Since the number of elements in

It is clear that the coverage is the most important quality aspect from
 the network point of view (penalty factor 
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{cov}}$
\end_inset

).
 Moreover, it imposes the biggest constraint to the optimization process,
 since the balance between SHO areas should not sacrifice network coverage.
 Another important characteristic that emerges from these values is the
 preference for minimizing areas where SHO capability is available in the
 uplink, but not in the downlink (penalty factor 
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{sho}}^{\uparrow}$
\end_inset

).
 As it has been described in Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 neighboring cells (Figure

 imposes a penalty value over areas where the SHO capability is available
 in the downlink, but not in the uplink.
 Recall that when accessing HSPA services, SHO is available only in the
 uplink.
 For this reason, the link throughput may benefit from the SHO in the uplink
 if it is available.
 The relative lower importance of the last penalty factor, when compared
 to the other ones, is directly related to the consequences of the unbalancing
 that such SHO areas may have on the network.
 In this case, only the HSPA throughput is affected, while the service accessibi
lity should not be an issue, given there is enough uplink coverage

\begin_layout Standard
The SHO-balancing problem has been tackled using three fundamentally different
 optimization algorithms, namely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Differential evolution (see Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:02-DE"

\end_inset

), from the family of evolutionary algorithms;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Differential ant-stigmergy algorithm (see Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:02-DASA"

\end_inset

), from the family of swarm-intelligence algorithms; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Simulated annealing (see Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:02-SA"

\end_inset

), from the family of classic metaheuristic algorithms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these algorithms shall minimize the objective function value by
 adopting essentially disparate approaches, hence the diversity of applying
 algorithms belonging to different families to solve the same optimization
 problem.
 Therefore, the result analysis shall establish which of the presented approache
s is better suited for solving the SHO-balancing problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following sections describe how the SHO-balancing problem is represented
 by the internal structure of each of the selected algorithms and their
 controlling parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Differential evolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DE algorithm features a parallel direct search method, which utilizes
 a population of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

-dimensional parameter vectors.
 The SHO-balancing problem is expressed in each component of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 of the population, which represents the pilot power of a target cell, i.e.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{ag}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots x_{c},\ldots,x_{D}\right\} ,\label{eq:07-DE_mapping}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}\in P_{c}$
\end_inset

 represents a candidate pilot-power setting of cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 indicates the generation of an individual 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in the population.
 Since there are 
\begin_inset Formula $|C|$
\end_inset

 cells in a mobile network, it follows that the population size, 
\begin_inset Formula $D=|C|$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the different variants of DE, the most popular one is used here, called
 
\emph on
DE/rand/1/bin
\emph default
.
 The nomenclature used to name this variant indicates the way the algorithm
 works:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
DE 
\emph default
denotes the differential evolution algorithm,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
rand 
\emph default
indicates that the individuals selected to compute the mutation values are
 randomly chosen,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1
\emph on
 
\emph default
specifies the number of pairs of selected solutions used to calculate the
 crossover vector, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
bin 
\emph default
means that a binomial recombination operator is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Differential ant-stigmergy algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mapping between the balancing problem and the DASA is similar to the
 one for DE:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{a}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots x_{i},\ldots,x_{D}\right\} .\label{eq:07-DASA_mapping}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
In this case, each ant, 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, creates its own solution vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{a}$
\end_inset

, during the minimization process.
 At the end of every iteration, and after all the ants have created solutions,
 they are evaluated to establish if any of them is better than the best
 solution found so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Simulated annealing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the SA perspective, the system under optimization is in a given 
\emph on
state
\emph default
 at each time step during the process.
 The objective function maps a system state to a value known as the 
\emph on
energy
\emph default
 of the system in that state.
 A 
\emph on
move
\emph default
 in the search space represents a change in the state of the system.
 Whether a move is performed or not depends on the values of the objective
 function and the temperature parameter (see Section
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:02-SA"

\end_inset

).
 After making a move, the system may exhibit lower or higher energy, depending
 on the current objective-function value.

At the beginning, a cell,

 Next, a change of +0.01

\begin_inset space ~

dB is applied with 50

% probability to 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c'}$
\end_inset

.
 The pilot power of cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c'$
\end_inset

 is expressed in dBm.
 The randomly generated pilot-power setting, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c'}^{\mathrm{new}}$
\end_inset

, is then validated, i.e., it must be an element of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c'}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c'}^{\mathrm{new}}$
\end_inset

 is not a valid pilot power, the loop is executed again, generating another
 random pilot power.
 Finally, the pilot power of cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c'}^{\mathrm{new}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that, as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $|P_{c'}|>1$
\end_inset

, the pseudo-code shown in Algorithm
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 shall never be trapped in an endless loop.
 On the other hand, if 
\begin_inset Formula $|P_{c'}|<2$
\end_inset

, there are no candidate pilot powers for cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c'$
\end_inset

, and thus there is no possibility of optimization.
 Notice also that the acceptance of a move in the search space is left to
 SA and its stochastic components.

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, the algorithm-parameter setup used during the simulations
 is given.
 In all three cases, the parameter names are given with their respective
 values and descriptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The parameters controlling the behavior of the DE algorithm were set as
 follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $NP=100$
\end_inset

, the population size;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mathrm{max}}=1000$
\end_inset

, the maximum number of generations for the algorithm to run;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $CR=0.8$
\end_inset

, the crossover constant; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $F=0.5$
\end_inset

, the mutation-scaling factor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the DASA, the parameters were set to the following values:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $m=10$
\end_inset

, the number of ants;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $b=10,$
\end_inset

 the discrete base;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=0.2$
\end_inset

, the pheromone dispersion factor;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $s_{+}=0.01$
\end_inset

, the global scale-increasing factor;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $s_{-}=0.01$
\end_inset

, the global scale-decreasing factor; and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=10{}^{-2}$
\end_inset

, the maximum parameter precision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The two parameters that control the behavior of SA are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $t_{\mathrm{initial}}=$
\end_inset

125, the initial temperature; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $it=$
\end_inset

100,000, the total number of iterations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, the exponential-lowering schema was chosen as the way the
 temperature was lowered during the SA searches.
 Note that the probability of an increase/decrease of the pilot power and
 the change step, the values of which were set to 50
\begin_inset space ~

% and 0.01

 of both parameters were set in advance.

In this section, the performance of the selected algorithms is presented.
 The analysis includes aspects related to solution quality and convergence
 speed.
 All experimental results were obtained after 30 independent runs, each
 of them limited to a maximum of 100,000 evaluations.
 The gathered results are shown in Table

It may be observed that DE reached the lowest objective-function value,
 closely followed by the DASA.
 Likewise, both algorithms arrived at very similar results for the worst,
 mean and standard-deviation values.
 SA, on the other hand, did not achieve comparable values, since its results
 are behind those of the DE and DASA.
 Notice that even the best SA solution is no better than the worst solution
 of the DASA.
 Moreover, the standard deviation exhibited by SA is one order of magnitude
 bigger than those of the DASA and DE.

, respectively.
 It is worth mentioning that every optimization run starts from a different
 solution, randomly constructed by picking a pilot-power setting, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}^{k}$

, from every 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1\le k\le|P_{c}|$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\forall c\in C$
\end_inset

.
 Notice how fast DE converged to a good solution.
 The DASA also converged considerably fast, although not as fast as DE did.
 After a number of evaluations without improvement, the DASA resets itself
 and continues searching from a new random point within the search space

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Despite this, and based on the flat profile the graph exhibits towards
 the end of the optimization run, it is clear that 100,000 evaluations is
 an adequate stopping criterion for all algorithms.
 The third algorithm, SA, slowly converged towards the best solution found,
 even though it was not as good as the solutions found by the DASA and DE.

 This condition, although it has not improved, does not expose the mobile
 network to malfunctioning, only to reduced throughput within these specific
 areas.
 However, the reduced throughput is relative, since there are many cells
 capable of serving HSDPA data access, as the downlink SHO condition confirms.
 For this reason, the serving cell should not only deliver HSDPA, but also
 take care of the user signaling and power control, received in the uplink.
 Clearly, this is only feasible in areas where uplink coverage is guaranteed.

It is worth mentioning that the simulation results were obtained for a real
 radio network with actual configuration data.
 Moreover, the hard constraints imposed to the optimization process (the
 pilot power limited to the

dB interval) ensure that the resulting configuration may be immediately
 applied to a mobile network.
 This fact can be contrasted with the spatial distribution of each of the
 optimized aspects, before and after applying the optimization results,
 as it is shown in Figures

 is a desired consequence of the fine-tuning procedure the network has been
 exposed to.
 Still, the improvements are present precisely over the areas that are most
 exposed to malfunctioning due to unbalanced SHO, e.g., the cell-coverage
 borders.

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter formally introduced a new optimization problem for 3G networks:
 the SHO-balancing problem.
 A characterization of the consequences that unbalanced SHO areas have on
 the quality of HSPA services was also given.
 Particularly, tackling the SHO-balancing problem was possible due to the
 improved performance delivered by the evaluation framework PRATO (see Chapter

).

Using an extension of the radio-network model presented in Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:06-Radio_network_model"

\end_inset

, the penalty scores of the objective function were set according to the
 configuration and layout of a real mobile network, deployed in Slovenia
 by Telekom Slovenije, d.d.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The balancing problem has been tackled by three optimization algorithms,
 namely DE, DASA and SA.
 All three algorithms were able to improve the given network configuration,
 DE being the most successful one.
 The presented results confirm that a great proportion of the SHO areas
 that were not balanced before the optimization were corrected, therefore
 significantly reducing the possibility of HSPA-service failures.
 Additionally, radio coverage was improved, while all other essential network
 services were not altered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the key advantages of the presented method is that it targets the
 optimization of a deployed network, for which the focus is to fine-tune
 the existing configuration instead of creating complete new solutions.
 Furthermore, a deployed network has a great number of hard-constraints
 that should be taken into account at the optimization stage.
 Yet, the presented approach is simple and versatile enough to be used in
 practically any working UMTS network.
 Moreover, the introduced model is applicable for mobile networks in heterogeneo
us environments, because it imposes no restrictions regarding cell layout
 or radio-propagation characteristics, which are completely adaptable through
 PRATO.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that, to the best of the author's knowledge, the
 formal definition of the SHO-balancing problem as presented here has not
 yet appeared in the related literature.
 Also note that although some methods proposed in this chapter have been
 particularly designed for problems that emerge during the planning of 3G
 radio networks, they may be adapted to other standards, e.g., 2G and 4G,
 without loss of generality.
