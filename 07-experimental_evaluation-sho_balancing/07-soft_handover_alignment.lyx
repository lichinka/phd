In Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Experimental-evaluation-the-service-coverage-problem"

\end_inset

, an application exploiting the advantages of faster evaluation methods
 has been introduced.
 Solving the service coverage problem for real-world networks capitalizes
 on the ability to tackle bigger problem instances, i.e.
 problems that, because of their size, were previously unsolvable in a feasible
 amount of time.
 This improved performance also allows solving optimization problems with
 a higher degree of complexity, usually represented by the evaluation of
 multi-dimensional non-convex objective functions.

This chapter focuses on solving a new optimization problem for 3G networks,
 dealing with downlink and uplink SHO areas (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:02-Handover-and-soft-handover"

\end_inset

).
 By introducing a penalty-based objective function and some hard constraints,
 the formal definition of the SHO-balancing problem in UMTS networks is
 given.
 The state-of-the-art mathematical model used and the penalty scores of
 the objective function are set according to the configuration and layout
 of a real mobile network, deployed in Slovenia by Telekom Slovenije, d.d.
 The balancing problem is then tackled by three optimization algorithms,
 each of them belonging to a different category of metaheuristics.

To the best of the author's knowledge, there is no reference in the literature
 to a simulation-based approach to find active downlink and uplink SHO areas.
 Additionally, there are no formal optimization methods known to the author
 that tackle the SHO balancing problem as described here.
 The approach described in this chapter extends the approach published by

Despite several built-in mechanisms that allow the radio network to overcome
 different problems due to the lack of SHO during a HSDPA connection, some
 abnormal cases do arise, especially in those areas where there is SHO capabilit
y in the uplink, but none in the downlink.
 An example of such a case is depicted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, which shows interference behavior during a HSPA connection in normal SHO
 conditions (a), and in unbalanced SHO conditions (b).
 Graph data are actual radio network statistics, taken from the mobile network
 deployed in Slovenia by Telekom Slovenije, d.d..
 The graph on the left (a) shows a normal HSUPA-enabled service situation,
 in which the measured interference is proportional to the traffic being
 served.
 Note how the noise rises with the increased traffic on cell 1, while its
 neighbor (cell 2) has almost no interference nor traffic.
 Moreover, the graph profile for both traffic and noise of cell 1 are almost
 identical.
 The graph on the right (b) depicts a problematic situation, where the noise
 level does not only rise on the cell serving the HSUPA services (cell 1),
 but also on the neighboring one.
 Notice how the interference level rises on the cell that has almost no
 traffic (cell 2).
 It is clear that the source of this noise rise is generated by the active
 connection on cell 1, which shows an increase in HSUPA traffic.
 However, the noise level profile on cell 2 does not follow its traffic,
 as it did in the normal situation (a).
 This is due to cell 2 not being part of the active set.
 Such situations appear when the UL coverage is larger than the DL coverage.
 Interestingly enough, this seems to be an exceptional case, as Holma and
 Toskala write in

Given the described context, the challenge is to achieve the correct balance
 or distribution of downlink and uplink SHO areas within a working UMTS
 network.
 Therefore, the network has to be fine-tuned to achieve a better SHO-area
 balancing, and thus avoiding the exceptional appearance of problematic
 situations as shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:07-Problem_illustration"

\end_inset

.
 This clearly implies that the mobile network configuration should not be
 excessively altered, since other aspects of the network are working well
 before starting the optimization process.
 Hence, the objective of the optimization problem is to find a CPICH power
 level configuration for all the cells in the target network, such that
 the balance of downlink and uplink SHO areas is improved and other network
 aspects are preserved.
 The optimization process takes into account different kinds of hardware
 (e.g.
 amplifiers, cables, and antennas), changing only the CPICH powers of the
 cells.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 describes downlink and uplink SHO areas, considering the static nature
 of the evaluation.
 By introducing a penalty-based objective function and some hard constraints,
 a formal definition of the SHO-balancing problem in UMTS networks is given.
 The mathematical model and the penalty scores of the objective function
 are set according to the configuration and layout of a real mobile network,
 deployed in Slovenia by Telekom Slovenije, d.d.
 The SHO settings are also taken from actual network configuration, still
 they were adapted to closely model interference and other dynamics present
 in the network.
 The balancing problem is then tackled by three optimization algorithms,
 each of them belonging to a different category of metaheuristics.
 The optimization results, as well as the performance of each of the optimizatio
n algorithms used, are afterwards analyzed.

to be correctly balanced, since the power control mechanism works in the
 uplink SHO, while the HSDPA is available only from the serving cell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It only makes sense to allow HSDPA-users in the soft handover area to receive
 data on the HS-DSCH if there is sufficiently good uplink coverage for the
 high speed dedicated physical control channel (HS-DPCCH) that carries the
 Layer- 1 AcklNack's and the channel quality indicator (CQI) report.
 The HS-DPCCH is power controlled relative to the uplink DCH that the user
 also transmits.
 However, as the DCH is in soft handover mode while the HS-DPCCH is only
 decoded at the serving HS-DSCH cell, this creates some potential power
 control imperfections, which implies that the HS-DPCCH requires a relatively
 high transmit power when the user is in soft handover mode.

, considering, among other variables, base-station locations and hardware.
 However, most mobile operators are unable to apply these contributions
 to a live network since the planning phase has long been concluded.
 Moreover, the great majority of the base stations have already been deployed
 and their hardware also installed.
 Therefore, from the mobile operator's point of view, mainly parameter and
 software optimization are the only tools available when it comes to QoS
 improvement (see Section

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, but there is no standardized method to ﬁnd a CPICH power setting.
 A number of existing approaches to resolve this issue exist in the related
 literature (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Such a wide spectrum of available procedures is directly related to the
 diverse criteria taken into account when assigning the CPICH power of a
 cell.
 The fundamental reason behind this fact is that the CPICH power is a common
 factor of various optimization problems in UMTS networks.

Optimization objective

\begin_layout Standard
Using the elements defined in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:07-Radio_network_model"

\end_inset

, we have constructed an objective function in cooperation with a team of
 radio engineers of the Radio Network Department at Telekom Slovenije, d.d.
 The objective function is constructed as a weighted sum, containing different
 costs that penalize the occurrence of specific SHO conditions in downlink
 and uplink, which may potentially cause the aforementioned malfunctioning,
 introduced in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sec:07-Motivation"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A cost-based objective function is the most natural and straight-forward
 way of defining the optimization objective.
 Besides it is easily extendable to include other future situations, also
 defining the mutual importance of the different phenomena taken into account
 at the optimization phase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, the definition of the objective function for the SHO-balancing problem
 is the minimization of the sum of penalty scores given as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\min f_{\mathrm{sho}}=\sum_{c\in C}\sum_{m\in M}pf_{\mathrm{cov}}(1-cov_{cm})+pf_{\mathrm{sho}}^{\uparrow}sho_{cm}^{\uparrow}(1-sho_{cm}^{\downarrow})+pf_{\mathrm{sho}}^{\downarrow}sho_{cm}^{\downarrow}(1-sho_{cm}^{\uparrow}),\label{eq:07-objective_function}

Optimization algorithms 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SHO-balancing problem has been tackled using three fundamentally different
 optimization algorithms, namely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
differential evolution (DE, see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:02-DE"

\end_inset

), from the family of evolutionary algorithms;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
differential ant-stigmergy algorithm (DASA, see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:02-DASA"

\end_inset

), from the family of swarm-intelligence algorithms; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
simulated annealing (SA, see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:02-SA"

\end_inset

), from the group of classic metaheuristic algorithms, targeted at combinatorial
 optimization problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these algorithms shall minimize the objective function value by
 adopting essentially disparate approaches, hence the diversity of applying
 algorithms belonging to different families to solve the same optimization
 problem.
 Therefore, the result analysis shall establish which of the presented approache
s is better suited for solving the SHO-balancing problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following sections describe how the SHO-balancing problem is represented
 (or mapped) by the internal structure of each of the selected algorithms
 and their controlling parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DE mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DE algorithm features a parallel direct search method, which utilizes
 a population of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

-dimensional parameter vectors.
 The SHO-balancing problem is expressed in each component of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 of the population, which maps to the CPICH power of one cell under optimization
, i.e.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{aG}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots x_{c},\ldots,x_{D}\right\} ,\label{eq:07-DE_mapping}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}\in P_{c}$
\end_inset

 represents a candidate CPICH power setting of cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 indicates the generation of an individual 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in the population.
 Since there are 
\begin_inset Formula $|C|$
\end_inset

 cells in the mobile network, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $D=|C|$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the different variants of DE, the most popular one is used here, called
 
\emph on
DE/rand/1/bin
\emph default
.
 The nomenclature used to name this variant indicates the way the algorithm
 works:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
DE 
\emph default
denotes the differential evolution algorithm,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
rand 
\emph default
indicates that the individuals selected to compute the mutation values are
 randomly chosen,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1
\emph on
 
\emph default
specifies the number of pairs of selected solutions used to calculate the
 weighted difference vector, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
bin 
\emph default
means that a binomial recombination operator is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four control parameters of the search process for DE were considered: the
 population size (
\begin_inset Formula $NP$
\end_inset

), the number of generations for the algorithm to run (
\begin_inset Formula $G_{max}$
\end_inset

), the crossover constant (
\begin_inset Formula $CR$
\end_inset

), and the mutation scaling factor (
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DASA mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mapping between the balancing problem and DASA is similar to the one
 for DE, depicted in Equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:07-DE_mapping"

\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{a}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots x_{i},\ldots,x_{D}\right\} \label{eq:07-DASA_mapping}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, each ant, 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, creates its own solution vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{a}$
\end_inset

, during the minimization process.
 At the end of every iteration, and after all the ants have created solutions,
 they are evaluated to establish if any of them is better than the best
 solution found so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are six parameters that control the way DASA explores the search space:
 the number of ants (
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

), the discrete base (
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

), the pheromone dispersion factor (
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

), the global scale-increasing factor (
\begin_inset Formula $s_{+}$
\end_inset

), the global scale-decreasing factor (
\begin_inset Formula $s_{-}$
\end_inset

), and the maximum parameter precision (
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
SA mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the SA perspective, the system under optimization is in a given 
\emph on
state
\emph default
 at each time step during the process.
 The objective function maps a system state to a value known as the 
\emph on
energy
\emph default
 of the system in that state.
 A 
\emph on
move
\emph default
 in the search space represents a change in the state of the system.
 After making a move, the system may exhibit lower or higher energy, depending
 on the results of the objective function.

 The CPICH power of cell

 is expressed in dBm.
 The randomly generated CPICH power setting, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c'}^{\mathrm{new}}$

 it must be an element of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c'}$
\end_inset

.
 If

\end_inset

 is not a valid CPICH power, step 2 is executed again, generating another
 random CPICH power.
 Finally, in step 4, the CPICH power of cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c'}^{\mathrm{new}}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

 On the other hand, if 
\begin_inset Formula $|P_{c'}|<2$
\end_inset

, there are no candidate CPICH powers for cell 
\begin_inset Formula $c'$
\end_inset

 and thus no possibility of optimization by means of CPICH power adjustment.
 Notice also that the acceptance of a move in the search space is left to
 SA and its stochastic components.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SA has two parameters to control the search process: the initial temperature
 (

Penalty factors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After extensive experimentation, and working in cooperation with the radio
 engineers from the Radio Network Department at Telekom Slovenije, d.d., the
 penalty factors from Equation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:07-objective_function"

\end_inset

) are set to the following values:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{cov}}=15$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{sho}}^{\uparrow}=13$
\end_inset

, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{sho}}^{\downarrow}=3$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear that coverage is the most important quality aspect from the
 network point of view (penalty factor 
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{cov}}$
\end_inset

).
 Moreover, it imposes the biggest constraint to the optimization process,
 since the balance between SHO areas should not sacrifice network coverage.
 Another important characteristic that emerges from these values is the
 preference for minimizing areas where SHO capability is available in the
 uplink, but not in the downlink (penalty factor 
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{sho}}^{\uparrow}$
\end_inset

).
 As it has been described in Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:07-Motivation"

\end_inset

, consequences of such SHO arrangement produce serious interference rise
 in neighboring cells (Figure
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

), which may also result in service inaccessibility.

 imposes a penalty value over areas where SHO capability is available in
 the downlink, but not in the uplink.
 Recall that when accessing HSPA services, SHO is available only in the
 uplink.
 For this reason, the link throughput may benefit from SHO in the uplink
 if it is available.
 The relative lower importance of the last penalty factor compared with
 the other ones is directly related to the consequences of such unbalancing
 of SHO areas may have on the network.
 In this case only HSPA throughput is affected, while the service accessibility
 should not be an issue, given there is enough uplink coverage

\begin_layout Standard
It may be observed that DE reaches the lowest objective function value,
 closely followed by DASA.
 Likewise, both algorithms reach very similar results for the worst, mean
 and standard deviation values.
 SA, on the other hand, did not achieve comparable values, since its results
 are behind those of DE and DASA.
 Notice that even the best SA solution is no better than the worst solution
 of DASA.
 Moreover, the standard deviation exhibited by SA is many times bigger to
 those of DASA and DE, induced by the greater level of variance of its results.

 It is worth mentioning that every optimization run starts from a different
 solution, randomly constructed by picking a CPICH power setting, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}^{k}$

, from every 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{c}$

 Notice how fast DASA converges to a good solution.
 After a number of evaluations without improvement, DASA resets itself and
 continues searching from a new random point within the search space 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Similarly, DE converges considerably fast, although not as fast as DASA
 does.
 It this case, DE does not reset itself if the current solution cannot be
 improved.
 Despite this, and based on the flat profile the graph exhibits towards
 the end of the optimization run, we are confident that 100,000 evaluations
 is an adequate stopping criterion for this algorithm.
 The third algorithm, SA, slowly converges towards the best solution found,
 even though it is not as good as the solutions found by DE and DASA.

The simulation running times have been intentionally omitted, since the

', which shows an expected decline, since it is the optimization aspect
 with the lowest penalty factor value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coverage has been improved with an average of 4.29%, whereas the coverage
 area where there is no SHO capability has been increased 7.74% in average.
 Areas where SHO is available in both downlink and uplink have also been
 improved, 3.75% in average.
 This particular improvement is interesting from the optimization point
 of view, because it had no explicit penalty factor set.
 Therefore, it may be understood as a consequence of the criteria completeness
 the objective function has taken into account.

The second most important optimized aspect in the SHO-balancing problem
 is the proportion of areas with uplink SHO and no SHO in the downlink (labeled

).
 This particular condition has been improved by almost 17% in average, greatly
 reducing the possibility of interference in neighboring cells when serving
 HSPA traffic.
 The last measured aspect takes into account areas with downlink SHO and
 no SHO in the uplink (labeled as

).
 This condition, although it hasn't improved, does not expose the mobile
 network to malfunctioning, only to reduced throughput within these specific
 areas.
 However, the reduced throughput is relative, since there are many cells
 capable of serving HSDPA data access, as the downlink SHO condition confirms.
 For this reason, the serving cell should not only deliver HSDPA, but also
 take care of the user signaling and power control, received in the uplink.
 Obviously, this is only feasible in areas where uplink coverage is guaranteed.

It is worth mentioning that the simulation results were obtained for a real
 mobile network with actual configuration data.
 Moreover, the hard constraints imposed to the optimization process (CPICH
 power limited within the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$

dB interval) ensure that the resulting configuration may be immediately
 applied to the mobile network.
 This fact can be contrasted with the spatial distribution of each of the
 optimized aspects, before and after applying the optimization results,
 as it is shown in Figures

 is a desired consequence of the fine-tuning procedure the network has been
 exposed to.
 Still, the improvements are present precisely over the areas that are most
 exposed to malfunctioning due to unbalanced SHO, e.g.
 their borders.

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter formally introduced a new optimization problem for 3G networks:
 the SHO-balancing problem.
 A characterization of the consequences unbalanced SHO areas have on the
 quality of HSPA services has also been given.
 Particularly, tackling the SHO-balancing problem was possible due to the
 improved performance delivered by the evaluation framework PRATO (see Chapter
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "chap:03-Framework-design-and-implementation"

\end_inset

).

Using a extension of the state-of-the-art radio-network model introduced
 in ...???, the penalty scores of the objective function were set according
 to the configuration and layout of a real mobile network, deployed in Slovenia
 by Telekom Slovenije, d.d.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The balancing problem has been tackled by three optimization algorithms,
 namely DE, DASA and SA.
 All three algorithms were able to improve the given network configuration,
 being DE the most successful one.
 The presented results confirm that a great proportion of the SHO areas,
 that were not aligned before the optimization, has been correctly balanced,
 therefore significantly reducing the possibility of HSPA-service failures.
 Additionally, radio coverage has been improved, while all other essential
 network services were not altered.

One of the key advantages of the presented method is that it targets the
 optimization of a deployed network, for which the focus is to fine-tune
 the existing configuration instead of creating complete new solutions.
 Furthermore, a deployed network has a great number of hard-constraints
 that should be taken into account at the optimization stage, yet the presented
 approach is simple and versatile enough to be used in practically any working
 UMTS network.
 Moreover, the introduced model is applicable for mobile networks in heterogeneo
us environments, because it imposes no restrictions regarding cell layout
 or radio-propagation characteristics, which are completely adaptable through
 PRATO.
