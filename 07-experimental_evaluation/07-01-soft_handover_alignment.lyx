This chapter introduces a static network simulator to find downlink and
 uplink SHO areas.
 By introducing a penalty-based objective function and some hard constraints,
 we formally define the problem of balancing SHO areas in UMTS networks.
 The state-of-the-art mathematical model used and the penalty scores of
 the objective function are set according to the configuration and layout
 of a real mobile network, deployed in Slovenia by Telekom Slovenije, d.d..
 The balancing problem is then tackled by three optimization algorithms,
 each of them belonging to a different category of metaheuristics.
 We report and analyze the optimization results, as well as the performance
 of each of the optimization algorithms used.

In mobile networks, handover is one of the main features that allows user's
 mobility 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "WCDMAforUMTS_RadioAccessForThirdGenerationMobileCommunications"

\end_inset

.
 The concept behind the handover operation is simple: when a user moves
 from the coverage area of a cell to the coverage area of a neighboring
 cell, the system creates a new connection with the latter cell and disconnects
 the user from the former one, while keeping the current connection active.
 Soft-handover (SHO), on the other hand, is a possibility available in mobile
 networks using the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technology,
 which the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) employs.
 SHO enhances handover functionality by allowing a user to potentially operate
 on multiple radio links in parallel.
 Since different users are separated by unique spreading codes, the detection
 of single user's signal is implemented by despreading with the same code
 sequence used in the transmitter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every mobile terminal constantly monitors the common pilot power channel
 (CPICH) of the connected cell and its neighbors.
 The information about these measurements is sent to the network by the
 user terminal (i.e.
 mobile).
 The SHO condition depends on the relative received signal quality from
 different cells and the SHO window, which triggers the addition of a cell
 to the user's active set.
 Depending on radio propagation characteristics and different transceiver
 capabilities, the radio transmission can gain more than 3 dB out of a SHO
 situation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "WCDMAforUMTS_RadioAccessForThirdGenerationMobileCommunications"

\end_inset

.
 From this point of view, SHO is a method to reduce interference and improve
 radio quality, particularly at the cell border where radio coverage is
 of inferior quality.
 In UMTS Release 99 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "3GPP_R99"

\end_inset

, SHO is specified to work from the network towards the user (i.e.
 downlink), and from the user towards the network (i.e.
 uplink).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the introduction of High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) as an improvement
 of the performance existing in WCDMA protocols, the role SHO plays in mobile
 network configuration and functioning slightly changed.
 The key difference is that High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) does
 not support SHO, while the High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) does.
 This particular distinction has some key implications in the balanced distribut
ion of SHO areas, and thus in the quality of HSPA services

Despite several built-in mechanisms that allow the network to overcome different
 problems due to the lack of SHO during a HSDPA connection, some abnormal
 cases do arise, especially in those areas where there is SHO capability
 in the uplink, but none in the downlink.
 An example of such a case is depicted in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, which shows interference behavior during a HSPA connection in normal SHO
 conditions (a), and in unbalanced SHO conditions (b).
 Graph data are actual radio network statistics, taken from the mobile network
 deployed in Slovenia by Telekom Slovenije, d.d..
 The graph on the left (a) shows a normal HSUPA-enabled service situation,
 in which the measured interference is proportional to the traffic being
 served.
 Note how the noise rises with the increased traffic on cell 1, while its
 neighbor (cell 2) has almost no interference nor traffic.
 Moreover, the graph profile for both traffic and noise of cell 1 are almost
 identical.
 The graph on the right (b) depicts a problematic situation, where the noise
 level does not only rise on the cell serving the HSUPA services (cell 1),
 but also on the neighboring one.
 Notice how the interference level rises on the cell that has almost no
 traffic (cell 2).
 It is clear that the source of this noise rise is generated by the active
 connection on cell 1, which shows an increase in HSUPA traffic.
 However, the noise level profile on cell 2 does not follow its traffic,
 as it did in the normal situation (a).
 This is due to cell 2 not being part of the active set.
 Such situations appear when the UL coverage is larger than the DL coverage.
 Interestingly enough, this seems to be an exceptional case, as Holma and
 Toskala write in

Given the described context, the challenge is to achieve the correct balance
 or distribution of downlink and uplink SHO areas within a working UMTS
 network.
 Therefore, the network has to be fine-tuned to achieve a better SHO-area
 balancing, and thus avoiding the appearance of problematic situations as
 shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:problem_illustration"

\end_inset

.
 This clearly implies that the mobile network configuration should not be
 excessively altered, since other aspects of the network are working well
 before starting the optimization process.
 Hence, we have decided to define an optimization problem which objective
 is to find a CPICH power level configuration for all the cells in the working
 network, such that the balance of downlink and uplink SHO areas is improved
 and other network aspects are preserved.
 The optimization process takes into account different kinds of hardware
 (e.g.
 amplifiers, cables, and antennas), but only the CPICH powers of the cells
 are to be changed.

In this paper we utilize a static network simulator, based on a state-of-the-art
 mathematical model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, to find downlink and uplink SHO areas.
 By introducing a penalty-based objective function and some hard constraints,
 we formally define the problem of balancing SHO areas in UMTS networks.
 The mathematical model and the penalty scores of the objective function
 are set according to the configuration and layout of a real mobile network,
 deployed in Slovenia by Telekom Slovenije, d.d..
 The SHO settings are also taken from actual network configuration, still
 they were adapted to closely model interference and other dynamics present
 in the network.
 The balancing problem is then tackled by three optimization algorithms,
 each of them belonging to a different category of metaheuristics.
 The optimization results, as well as the performance of each of the optimizatio
n algorithms used, are afterwards analyzed.

to be correctly balanced, since the power control mechanism works in the
 uplink SHO, while the HSDPA is available only from the serving cell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It only makes sense to allow HSDPA-users in the soft handover area to receive
 data on the HS-DSCH if there is sufficiently good uplink coverage for the
 high speed dedicated physical control channel (HS-DPCCH) that carries the
 Layer- 1 AcklNack's and the channel quality indicator (CQI) report.
 The HS-DPCCH is power controlled relative to the uplink DCH that the user
 also transmits.
 However, as the DCH is in soft handover mode while the HS-DPCCH is only
 decoded at the serving HS-DSCH cell, this creates some potential power
 control imperfections, which implies that the HS-DPCCH requires a relatively
 high transmit power when the user is in soft handover mode.

, considering, among other variables, base station locations and hardware.
 The fact is that most mobile operators are unable to apply these contributions
 to a live network since the planning phase has long been concluded.
 Moreover, the great majority of the base stations have already been deployed
 and their hardware also installed.
 Therefore, from the mobile operator's point of view, mainly parameter and
 software optimization are the tools available when it comes to improvement
 of the quality of service and troubleshooting the network in the short
 term.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, but there is no standardized method to ﬁnd a CPICH power setting.
 A number of existing approaches to resolve this issue exist in the related
 literature (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Such a wide spectrum of proposed procedures is directly related to the
 diverse criteria taken into account when assigning the CPICH power of a
 cell.
 The fundamental reason behind this fact is that the CPICH power is a common
 factor of various optimization problems in UMTS networks.

 it also defines the mutual importance of the different situations taken
 into account at the optimization phase.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We tackled the problem of balancing SHO areas using three fundamentally
 different optimization algorithms, namely:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
differential evolution, from the family of evolutionary algorithms;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
differential ant-stigmergy algorithm, from the family of swarm-intelligence
 algorithms; and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
simulated annealing, from the group of classic metaheuristic algorithms,
 targeted at combinatorial optimization problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these algorithms shall minimize the objective function value by
 adopting essentially disparate approaches, hence the diversity of applying
 algorithms belonging to different families to solve the same optimization
 problem.
 In this way we want to find out whether any of the presented approaches
 is better suited for solving our problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following sections we give a short introduction about their functioning
 and controlling parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Differential evolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differential evolution (DE) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "storn1997_Differential_evolution"

\end_inset

 is a simple and powerful evolutionary algorithm proposed for global optimizatio
n.
 A wide range of optimization problems have been solved by applying DE 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "das2010_differential_evolution_state_of_the_art"

\end_inset

.
 The algorithm exhibits a parallel direct search method, which utilizes
 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

-dimensional parameter vectors.
 The balancing problem is expressed in each component of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 of the population, which maps to the CPICH power of one cell under optimization
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{aG}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots x_{i},\ldots,x_{D}\right\} ,\label{eq:DE_mapping}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\in P_{i}$
\end_inset

 represents a candidate CPICH power setting of cell 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 indicates the generation of an individual 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in the population.
 Since there are 
\begin_inset Formula $|N|$
\end_inset

 cells in the mobile network, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $D=|N|$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In each generation, DE produces new parameter vectors by adding the weighted
 difference between two population vectors to a third one 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "storn1997_Differential_evolution"

\end_inset

.
 The resulting vector is retained if it yields a lower objective function
 value than a predetermined population member; otherwise, the old vector
 is kept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are different variants of DE.
 We have chosen the most popular one to solve our optimization problem,
 called 
\emph on
DE/rand/1/bin
\emph default
.
 The nomenclature used to name this variant indicates the way the algorithm
 works:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
DE 
\emph default
denotes the differential evolution algorithm,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
rand 
\emph default
indicates that the individuals selected to compute the mutation values are
 randomly chosen,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
1
\emph on
 
\emph default
specifies the number of pairs of selected solutions used to calculate the
 weighted difference vector, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
bin 
\emph default
means that a binomial recombination operator is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We considered four parameters to control the search process of DE: the populatio
n size, the maximum number of generations for the algorithm to run, the
 crossover constant, and the mutation scaling factor.

Differential ant-stigmergy algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the metaheuristic Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dorigo2006ant_colony_optimization"

\end_inset

, the differential ant-stigmergy algorithm (DASA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "korosec2010_DASA"

\end_inset

 provides a framework to successfully cope with high-dimensional numerical
 optimization problems.
 It creates a fine-grained discrete form of the search space, representing
 it as a graph.
 This graph is then used as the walking paths for the ants, which iteratively
 improve the temporary best solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mapping between the balancing problem and DASA is similar to the one
 depicted in Equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:DE_mapping"

\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{a}=\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},\ldots x_{i},\ldots,x_{D}\right\} \label{eq:DASA_mapping}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, each ant, 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, creates its own solution vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{a}$
\end_inset

, during the minimization process.
 At the end of every iteration, and after all the ants have created solutions,
 they are evaluated to establish if any of them is better than the best
 solution found so far.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are six parameters that control the way DASA explores the search space:
 the number of ants, the discrete base, the pheromone dispersion factor,
 the global scale-increasing factor, the global scale-decreasing factor,
 and the maximum parameter precision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Simulated annealing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the third optimization algorithm to tackle the balancing problem we have
 chosen simulated annealing (SA) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kirkpatrick_OptimizationBySimulatesAnnealing"

\end_inset

, a classic metaheuristic algorithm often used when the search space is
 discrete.
 SA has proved to be a solid optimization algorithm, capable of giving high-qual
ity solutions to a wide scope of optimization problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Suman_SurveyOfSimulatedAnnealing"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At each time step during the process, the system under optimization is in
 a given 
\emph on
state
\emph default
.
 The objective function maps a system state to a value known as the 
\emph on
energy
\emph default
 of the system in that state.
 A 
\emph on
move
\emph default
 in the search space represents a change in the state of the system.
 After making a move, the system may exhibit lower or higher energy, depending
 on the results of the objective function.
 When dealing with minimization problems, a better state always describes
 lower energy than the previous one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SA incorporates the notion of 
\emph on
temperature
\emph default
, by which the probability of moving the current state of the system into
 a worst one is lowered as the temperature decreases.
 Exploration of the search space is thus induced at higher temperature,
 whereas exploitation appears at lower temperature, when only improving
 moves are accepted.

Penalty factors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After extensive experimentation, and working in cooperation with the radio
 engineers from the Radio Network Department at Telekom Slovenije, d.d., the
 penalty factors from Equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:objective_function"

\end_inset

) are set to the following values:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{COV}}=15$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{SHO}}^{\uparrow}=13$
\end_inset

, and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{SHO}}^{\downarrow}=3$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear that coverage is the most important quality aspect from the
 network point of view (penalty factor 
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{COV}}$
\end_inset

).
 Moreover, it imposes the biggest constraint to the optimization process,
 since the balance between SHO areas should not sacrifice network coverage.
 Another important characteristic that emerges from these values is the
 preference for minimizing areas where SHO capability is available in the
 uplink, but not in the downlink (penalty factor 
\begin_inset Formula $pf_{\mathrm{SHO}}^{\uparrow}$
\end_inset

).
 As it has been described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Introduction"

\end_inset

, one of the consequences of such SHO arrangement produces serious interference
 rise in neighboring cells (Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:problem_illustration"

\end_inset

), which may also result in service inaccessibility.
 The last factor

 imposes a penalty value over areas where SHO capability is available in
 the downlink, but not in the uplink.
 Remember that when accessing HSPA services, SHO is available only in the
 uplink.
 For this reason, the link throughput may benefit from SHO in the uplink
 if it is available.
 The relative lower importance of the last penalty factor compared with
 the other ones is directly related to the consequences of such unbalancing
 of SHO areas may have on the network.
 In this case only HSPA throughput is affected, while the service accessibility
 should not be an issue, given there is enough uplink coverage

GB of RAM running a 64-bit Linux operating system.
 The implementation languages used were C and Python, with the latter mostly
 used as ‘glue’ to hold the different implementation parts together, as
 well as for I/O operations.
 To lower the time needed to run one optimization round, we have implemented
 the entire objective function evaluation using OpenCL and executed it on
 a nVidia GeForce GTX 260.
 This individual improvement exhibited more than 15x execution time speed-up
 when compared to the original CPU-only version.

As we may observe, DE reaches the lowest objective function value, closely
 followed by DASA.
 Likewise, both algorithms reach very similar results for the worst, mean
 and standard deviation values.
 SA, on the other hand, did not achieve similar values, since its results
 are behind those of DE and DASA.
 Notice that even the best SA solution is no better than the worst solution
 of DASA.
 Moreover, the standard deviation exhibited by SA is many times bigger to
 those of DASA and DE, inducing the greater level of variance of its results.

 Notice how fast DASA converges to a good solution.
 After a number of evaluations without improvement, DASA resets itself and
 continues searching from a new random point within the search space

, hence the jagged profile on the graph.
 Similarly, DE converges considerably fast, although not as fast as DASA
 does.
 It this case, DE does not reset itself if the current solution cannot be
 improved.
 Despite this, and based on the flat profile the graph exhibits towards
 the end of the optimization run, we are confident that 100,000 evaluations
 is an adequate stopping criterion for this algorithm.
 The last algorithm, SA, slowly converges towards the best solution found,
 even though it is not as good as the solutions found by DE and DASA.

 view.
 After 30 independent runs of each of the three algorithms, the best results
 obtained where evaluated for improvement and decline of each of the measured
 network aspects.
 The results are shown in Table

‘, which shows an expected change, since it is the optimization aspect with
 the lowest penalty factor value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coverage has been improved with an average of 4.29%, whereas the coverage
 area where there is no SHO capability has been increased 7.74% in average.
 The SHO areas, where this facility is available in both the downlink and
 uplink, has also been improved 3.75% in average.
 This particular improvement is interesting from the optimization point
 of view, because it had no explicit penalty factor set.
 Therefore we understand this enhancement as a consequence of the completeness
 of criteria, taken into account in the objective function.

The second most important optimized aspect in the balancing problem is the
 proportion of areas with uplink SHO and no SHO in the downlink (labeled

 This particular condition has been improved by almost 17% in average, greatly
 reducing the possibility of interference in neighboring cells when serving
 HSPA traffic.
 The last measured aspect takes into account areas with downlink SHO and
 no SHO in the uplink (labeled as ‘

).
 This condition, although it hasn't improved, does not expose the mobile
 network to malfunctioning, only to reduced throughput within these specific
 areas.
 However, the reduced throughput is relative, since there are many cells
 capable of serving HSDPA data access, as the downlink SHO condition confirms.
 For this reason, the serving cell should not only deliver HSDPA, but should
 also take care of the user signaling and power control, received in the
 uplink.
 Obviously, this is only feasible in areas where uplink coverage is guaranteed.

It is worth mentioning that these results were obtained for a working mobile
 network with live data.
 Moreover, the hard constraints imposed to the optimization process (CPICH
 power limited within the 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$

2 dB interval) ensure that the resulting configuration may be immediately
 applied to the mobile network.
 This fact can be contrasted with the spatial distribution of each of the
 optimized aspects, before and after applying the optimization results,
 as it is shown in Figures

 is a desired consequence of the fine-tuning procedure the network has been
 exposed to.
 Still, the improvements are present precisely over the areas that are most
 exposed to malfunctioning due to unbalanced SHO, e.g.
 their borders.

\begin_layout Standard
We have presented the problem of balancing SHO areas in UMTS networks and
 characterized some of the consequences unbalanced SHO areas have on the
 quality of HSPA services.
 By using a static network simulator, based on a state-of-the-art mathematical
 model, we have located downlink and uplink SHO areas.
 Both the mathematical model and the penalty scores of the objective function
 have been set according to the configuration and layout of a real mobile
 network, deployed in Slovenia by Telekom Slovenije, d.d..
 The balancing problem has been tackled by three optimization algorithms,
 namely DE, DASA and SA.
 To the best of our knowledge, there is no reference in the literature to
 a simulation-based approach to find active SHO areas in the downlink and
 uplink.
 Additionally, as far as we know, the SHO balancing problem, as described
 in this paper, has not yet been tackled by any formal optimization method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All three algorithms were able to improve the given network configuration,
 being DE the most successful one.
 Based on this fact, we may say that DE was the best suited algorithm for
 solving our problem.
 The presented results confirm that a great proportion of the non-aligned
 SHO areas, that were present before the optimization, were corrected, therefore
 significantly reducing the possibility of HSPA-service failures within
 these areas.
 Additionally, network coverage has been improved, while all other essential
 network services were not altered.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the key advantages of the presented method is that it targets the
 optimization of a deployed network, for which the focus is put on fine-tuning
 an existing configuration instead of creating complete new solutions.
 Furthermore, a deployed network has a great number of hard-constraints
 that should be taken into account at the optimization stage, yet our approach
 is simple and versatile enough for it to be used in practically any working
 UMTS network.
 Moreover, our model is applicable for mobile networks in heterogeneous
 environments, because it imposes no restrictions regarding cell layout
 or radio propagation characteristics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further improve the presented results, dynamic effects, such as fast
 power control, should be included in the simulations, since it is a valuable
 element of a WCDMA mobile system.
 Another extension of the current work is to incorporate antenna tilt as
 an additional objective of the optimization process.
 This should certainly include experimentation with models and algorithms
 that support multiobjective optimization.
