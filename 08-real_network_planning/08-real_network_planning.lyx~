The objective of Chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:05-Framework_parameter_tuning"

\end_inset

 was to ease the execution of radio-network planning activities, the complexity
 of which is generally beyond the scope of a manual approach.
 In this context, PRATO was presented as a tool that can help an engineer
 in realizing his or her everyday network-planning tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important factor to further validate the adoption of the presented
 framework is to verify its accuracy.
 This is especially important in real-world scenarios, where it is not feasible
 to improve the performance of radio-coverage predictions at the cost of
 precision loss.
 The scope of this chapter is therefore to establish that the accuracy of
 the radio-propagation predictions of PRATO, as described previously in
 Chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:04-Framework-design-and-implementation"

\end_inset

, is adequate for real-world, radio-network planning purposes.
 To this end, and with the help of the radio engineers at Telekom Slovenije,
 d.d., some real-world radio-propagation scenarios are calculated using PRATO
 and an enterprise, industrial software.
 During the experimentation phase, as well as when comparing the outcome,
 the engineers provided guidelines to assess the results from a practical
 radio-network planning perspective.
 The objective is to compare both tools in terms of solution quality and
 computational-time performance.

The rest of this chapter is organized as follows.
 Section

 A description of the testing environment, including three networks, is
 given in Section

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a mobile operator, the utilization of a radio-network planning tool
 has clear economical and technical benefits.
 As it has been pointed out throughout the previous chapters, the usage
 of accurate planning tools minimizes the operator's costs and effort, and
 also automates manual processes.
 In this sense, the important role that a radio-planning tool has during
 the optimization process of a network was also presented.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, up to this stage, little has been said regarding the reliability
 of PRATO as a tool for everyday coverage planning.
 In other words, a question has not yet been answered: is PRATO able to
 provide sufficiently accurate estimates of a network-coverage performance?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it was mentioned in Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:04-Motivation"

\end_inset

, the accuracy of the coverage predictions has a fundamental impact on the
 performance accuracy of the framework.
 For this reason, one of the objectives of this chapter is to assess the
 precision of several coverage-propagation predictions of PRATO and an enterpris
e radio-planning tool, the design of which is tailored to be used in industrial
 environments, using field measurements as a reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second objective of this chapter is related to the the high-performance
 characteristics of PRATO.
 To this end, an insight to the computational-time performance of PRATO,
 compared to the commercial radio-planning tool

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Field measurements are used as the reference for analyzing the accuracy
 of a set of coverage-prediction calculations.
 The reference measurements were conducted in three commercial networks
 of different sizes and technologies.
 Namely, Net
\begin_inset Formula $_{11}$
\end_inset

 denotes a GSM network that contains 830 BSs with 1240 cells, Net
\begin_inset Formula $_{12}$
\end_inset

 is an UMTS network with 700 BSs and 2000 cells, and Net
\begin_inset Formula $_{13}$
\end_inset

 is a LTE network featuring 120 BSs with 350 cells.
 The selected networks extend throughout diverse geographical regions, thus
 covering different terrains and representing various environmental characterist
ics, including urban, suburban and rural.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using a similar setup as presented in Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:05-Field_measurements"

\end_inset

, the average-received power was measured on the field for each network.
 The field measurements were captured with the air-interface measurement
 tool for the corresponding network technology.
 The captured measurements are lower-bounded by the receiver sensitivity
 of a given technology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to minimize the error impact in the measured signals, all field
 measurements were processed so that a single value, the median, was calculated
 for each measured location.
 Similar to Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:05-Field_measurements"

\end_inset

, this step improves the data quality in terms of possible deviations due
 to external factors during the measurement gathering on the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding the radio-propagation models, the coverage predictions were calculated
 using the propietrary model of the commercial tool, and the previously
 introduced model for PRATO (see Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:04-Radio_propagation_model"

\end_inset

).
 Additionally, the coverage-prediction parameters were equally set in both
 tools (see Table

), it is clear that the difference between each pair of (a) and (b) diagrams
 is minor.
 A small difference is present on the commercial tool, the predictions of
 which show a slightly greater deviation with respect to the measurements.
 Therefore, it can be concluded that the prediction results of PRATO are
 comparable with the results of the commercial tool for the three test networks.
 Moreover, the presented analysis also confirms that the calculated results
 are independent of the frequency band used, since each test network operates
 in a different frequency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, each of the test networks extended over different terrain
 types and environments, e.g., urban and suburban areas.
 Since the curves of the presented charts show similar profiles for the
 difference between the measurements and simulations for both tools, the
 applicability of PRATO for arbitrary terrain types can also be expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice also that PRATO generated similar results as the commercial tool
 in all three cases, irrespectively of the operational frequency or chosen
 terrain type.
 The predicted values are also comparable for different distances between
 the BSs and UEs.
 Moreover, a slight improvement can be observed in some of the prediction
 values of PRATO, because they better resemble the profile shown by the
 field measurements.

 The time-measurement gathering was performed during the simulations presented
 in the previous section.
 The PRATO-CPU deployed used six workers and one master process.
 For the PRATO-GPU configuration, the same process deployment was used,
 and the worker processes operated on the dual GPU, i.e., two GPUs on one
 board, each of which featured 1.5

The benefits of the parallel implementation of PRATO is clear in all three
 cases.
 Moreover, the multi-GPU support increases the running-time performance

 These results confirm that the use PRATO as a radio-planning tool in a
 real-world environment is feasible and it outperforms the compared commercial
 tool in terms of computational-time performance.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The radio planning of modern cellular networks requires efficient and exact
 radio-signal coverage calculations.
 In this context, the unified framework PRATO was evaluated from a radio-network
 planning point-of-view by comparing its simulation results with field measureme
nts.
 The same analysis was applied to a professional software application in
 order to assess the results of PRATO from a quality and performance perspective
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The extensive analyses presented in this chapter showed satisfactory results.
 Compared to a professional network-planning tool, the result accuracy achieved
 is completely comparable irrespective of the terrain type or operational
 frequency, while the computational speed is many times higher.
 These results confirm that PRATO does not reduce the solution quality due
 to the increased performance.
 Indeed, its suitability for use in a real-world environment, addressing
 different radio-planning activities by simulation, was also confirmed.
 This fact makes the framework interesting for researchers as well as for
 radio-network engineers.
