\begin_layout Chapter
Conclusion and further work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have presented an open-source simulation framework for coverage-planning
 and optimization of radio networks (PRATO)

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Encouraged by the favorable results, further work will include abstracting
 the introduced MWD principle into a multi-purpose parallel framework such
 as Charm++

, which provides a functionality for overlapping execution and communication,
 as well as fault tolerance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, as PRATO is also a free and open-source software project

, it can be readily modified and extended to support, for example, other
 propagation models and post-processing algorithms.
 This characteristic provides it with a clear advantage when compared to
 commercial and closed-source tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparison of our experimental results with other algorithms dealing with
 the same and similar problems would be useful.
 However, this task is not straightforward, since the results of several
 works (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Gerdenitsch_PhD:2004,Turke_Advanced.site.configuration.techniques:2005"

\end_inset

) depend on black-box evaluations, making experimental association very
 difficult, if possible at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All in all, we consider that the present work provides a robust foundation
 for future work on grid-based metaheuristics with expensive objective-function
 evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In future work, we will consider further analysis of our parallel-agent
 approach, including experimentation with different parameters, in order
 to gain better understanding of the dynamics leading the metaheuristic
 during the search process.
 Multi-GPU environments present an interesting possibility, where evaluator(s)
 and worker agents are run on separate GPU devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further improve the presented results, dynamic effects, such as fast
 power control, should be included in the simulations, particularly for
 recognizing dynamic functionality like SHO in a WCDMA mobile system.
 Another extension of the current work is to incorporate antenna tilt as
 an additional objective of the optimization process.
 This should certainly include experimentation with models and algorithms
 that support multiobjective optimization.
