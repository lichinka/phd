\begin_layout Standard
The methods and tools introduced in this thesis have a direct correlation
 with the simulation and optimization of radio networks in general and with
 those of the 3G and 4G in particular.
 We will introduce the steps necessary to mitigate the problem of experimental
 reproducibility found in most published works, by simplifying setup, execution,
 and sharing of experimental results.
 With the development of the framework, we will evaluate and assess the
 possibilities it offers as a support system for simulation and optimization
 problems of radio networks.
 By including parallel programming techniques for computer clusters and
 GPUs, we intend to go beyond the classical methodology provided by previous
 works, taking advantage of the inherent parallelism of some optimization
 techniques.
 We will also be looking into the application of many advances in HPC that
 should provide the framework with the computing power needed to improve
 the simulation process, thus enhancing its scalability to support real-world
 3G radio networks.
 Finally, since we believe that this work will only become truly productive
 through the cooperation and long-term development of the scientific and
 engineering community, we will be releasing the source code, algorithms,
 documentation, and data to the public domain.
 This way, anyone will be able to use and to extend the framework for their
 own needs.
 Encouraging cooperation and sharing of experimentation-related tools and
 data should be a common goal from which everyone will benefit.

\begin_layout Standard
We have presented an open-source simulation framework for coverage-planning
 and optimization of radio networks (PRATO)

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Encouraged by the favorable results, further work will include abstracting
 the introduced MWD principle into a multi-purpose parallel framework such
 as Charm++ 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Kale-The_Charm_Approach:2013"

\end_inset

, which provides a functionality for overlapping execution and communication,
 as well as fault tolerance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Encouraged by the favorable results, further work will include abstracting
 some of the introduced principles and methodology into a multi-purpose
 library for parallel simulation of radio-coverage predictions, which shall
 be published as free and open source software.
 The aim of such tool is to ultimately validate the suitability and usefulness
 of the presented framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, in the context of radio-coverage planning activities carried
 out at the Radio Network department of Telekom Slovenije, d.d., supplementary
 testing of PRATO as a coverage-planning tool is currently being conducted.
 So far, the performed predictions show evidence of faster and high-quality
 results when compared with well-established industrial software tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, as PRATO is also a free and open-source software project

\end_inset

, it can be readily modified and extended to support, for example, other
 propagation models and post-processing algorithms.
 This characteristic provides it with a clear advantage when compared to
 commercial and closed-source tools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparison of our experimental results with other algorithms dealing with
 the same and similar problems would be useful.
 However, this task is not straightforward, since the results of several
 works (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Gerdenitsch_PhD:2004,Turke_Advanced.site.configuration.techniques:2005"

\end_inset

) depend on black-box evaluations, making experimental association very
 difficult, if possible at all.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All in all, we consider that the present work provides a robust foundation
 for future work on grid-based metaheuristics with expensive objective-function
 evaluation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In future work, we will consider further analysis of our parallel-agent
 approach, including experimentation with different parameters, in order
 to gain better understanding of the dynamics leading the metaheuristic
 during the search process.
 Multi-GPU environments present an interesting possibility, where evaluator(s)
 and worker agents are run on separate GPU devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further improve the presented results, dynamic effects, such as fast
 power control, should be included in the simulations, particularly for
 recognizing dynamic functionality like SHO in a WCDMA mobile system.
 Another extension of the current work is to incorporate antenna tilt as
 an additional objective of the optimization process.
 This should certainly include experimentation with models and algorithms
 that support multiobjective optimization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that some methods proposed in this thesis have been
 particularly designed for problems emerging in radio planning of 3G networks.
 Despite this, they may be adapted to other standards, e.g.
 GSM or LTE, without lose of generality.
 Moreover, some of them may even be applied in other research areas, e.g.,
 parallelization techniques in the area of greographical information sciences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As it was mentioned in the introduction, it is important to understand that
 the models used in scientific simulations and engineering never offer a
 perfect model of the system they represent, but only a subset of its compositio
n and dynamics.
 For this reason, experimentation and expert observation will always be
 essential as reference points for understanding the studied phenomena.
 Consequently, problems categorized as of large size and of considerable
 complexity represent a challenge, because of the different involved disciplines
 and the degree of difficulty of their modeling.
 Radio networks, in particular those of the third and fourth generations,
 fall under this characterization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides the convenience of a literature overview as presented here, it is
 very important to develop a feeling for the properties, advantages and
 drawbacks of the respective methods.
 Moreover, the recommendations of radio experts regarding the interpretation
 of the solutions and the feedback from everyday network operation are an
 essential input for establishing high-quality optimization methods.
 In this sense, and based on our own experience, the expert's advice is
 irreplaceable and a most valuable contribution to the research work.

The work in this thesis has led to the following original contributions
 to science: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 A unied anomalous and suspicious behavior detection framework: We proposed
 a unied framework for detection of anomalous and suspicious behavior that
 can be observed from complex, spatio-temporal sequential data generated
 by an agent moving in a physical environment.
 The framework incorporates several components to address the main challenges
 and is demonstrated empirically in three studies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Contribution to anomalous and suspicious behavior detection: We gave the
 rst clear problem denition and established a theoretical framework for
 anomalous and suspicious behavior detection from agent traces to show how
 to optimally perform detection.
 We discussed why detection error is often inevitable and proved the lower
 error bound.
 We further provided several heuristic approaches that either estimated
 distributions required to perform detection or directly rank the behavior
 signatures using machine-learning approaches.

The contributions of this thesis to the fields of telecommunications and
 computer sciences include the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
State-of-the-art overview of optimization methods for 3G radio networks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design and development of a framework that provides an open environment
 for radio network simulations, implemented for execution on computer clusters
 and GPUs.
 The framework will allow the scientific community to share a common domain
 to run the simulations needed by modern optimization methods, since most
 currently available simulation tools are proprietary and therefore unsuitable
 for experimental reproducibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Improvement of quality and speed of renowned mathematical models, used for
 radio propagation predictions, by applying parameter optimization and paralleli
zation techniques.
 The expected speed improvement should be of at least one order of magnitude.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Proposal of a new algorithm, based on autonomous agents, to solve the service
 coverage problem.
 The solved problem instances should be of bigger size than ever solved
 in the literature and reach equal or better quality thereof.
 This should make our approach applicable for large real-world problem instances
 and data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Identification of a new optimization problem in 3G radio networks that deals
 with soft-handover alignment of downlink and uplink areas.
 By solving this problem, we should avoid abnormal network functioning in
 areas where there is soft-handover capability in the uplink, but none in
 the downlink.
 So far this problem has been solved manually by radio experts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Empirical comparison of the proposed metaheuristic algorithm against the
 existing state-of-the-art optimization algorithms on the soft-handover
 alignment problem.
