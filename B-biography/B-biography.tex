\noindent Lucas Benedi\v{c}i\v{c} was born on December 12, 1977 in
Buenos Aires, Argentina. After enrolling as a grade student at the
University of Buenos Aires, he attended and completed the first 4
years of the undergraduate programme in computer sciences at the Faculty
of Exact and Natural Sciences.

After moving to Slovenia in 2002, he enrolled the University of Ljubljana,
Faculty of Computer and Information Science, where he graduated in
2007 with the work titled »Application development using open-source
technologies«.

In September 2007, he started his postgraduate studies at the University
of Primorska, Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information
Technologies, after enrolling the Masters' study programme for computer
sciences. He graduated in 2009 with the work titled »Optimization
of Common Pilot Channels in UMTS Networks«.

Towards the end of 2007, he was awarded a scholarship for continuing
postgraduate studies in Slovenia. The award was received after winning
an open contest of problem solving, organized by Halcom, d.d.

In fall 2009, he enrolled in the PhD program entitled \textquotedblleft{}Information
and Communication Technologies\textquotedblright{} under the supervision
of Assistant Professor Peter Koro¨ec, at the Jo¸ef Stefan International
Postgraduate School in Ljubljana, Slovenia.

In November 2009 he became a junior researcher from industry, funded
by the European Union through the European Social Fund. During this
period he is holding working positions at Telekom Slovenije, d.d.,
in research and development within the Radio Network Department, and
at the Jo¸ef Stefan Institute, in the Computer Systems Department.

In 2011 he attended and successfully completed the summer institute
»Scientific Computing in the Americas: the challenge of massive parallelism«,
organized by the Pan-American Advanced Studies Institute, Boston University.
The focus of the institute was on advanced topics of theory and programming
of massively parallel processors.

In early 2012, he received an invitation to work as a visiting researcher
at the Nagasaki Advanced Computer Center (NACC) at the University
of Nagasaki, Japan. His joint research work at NACC is to be completed
by the end of 2012.

His research interests include combinatorial and numerical optimization,
mostly applied to optimization problems in the area of 3G radio networks,
metaheuristic algorithms, parallel and GPU computing. Over the last
few years, he has presented his research work at several international
conferences and workshops in the areas of evolutionary computation,
optimization and parallel computing.
