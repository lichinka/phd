There are two strong reasons why this has occurred. First the models are very rich in mathematical structure and hence can form the theoretical basis for use in a wide range of applications. Sec-ond the models, when applied properly, work very well in practice for several important applications. In this paper we attempt to care-fully and methodically review the theoretical aspects of this type of statistical modeling and show how they have been applied to selected problems in machine recognition of speech.

abstract = {Interface agents are computer programs that provide personalized assistance to a user dealing with computer based applications. By understanding the tasks the user performs in a software application an interface agent could be aware of the context that represents the user’s focus of attention at each particular moment. With this purpose, plan recognition aims at identifying the plans or goals of a user from the tasks he (for simplicity, we use he to refer to the user, but we do not mean any distinctions about sexes) performs. A prerequisite for the recognition of plans is knowledge of a user’s possible tasks and the combination of these tasks in complex task sequences, which describes typical user behavior. Plan recognition will enable an interface agent to reason about what the user might do next so that it can determine how to assist him. In this work we present the state of the art in Plan Recognition, paying special attention to the features that make it useful to interface agents. These features include the ability to deal with uncertainty, multiple plans, multiple interleaved goals, overloaded tasks, noisy tasks, interruptions and the capability to adapt to a particular user.},

No complex activity models and no supervised feature selections are used. We divide the video into equal length segments and classify the extracted features into prototypes, from which a prototype-segment co-occurrence matrix is computed. Motivated by a similar problem in document-keyword analysis, we seek a correspondence relationship between prototypes and video segments which satisfies the transitive closure constraint. We show that an important sub-family of correspondence functions can be reduced to co-embedding prototypes and segments to N-D Euclidean space. We prove that an efficient, globally optimal algorithm exists for the co-embedding problem. Experiments on various real-life videos have validated our approach.},

The system acquires color images from a stationary video camera and applies state of the art algorithms to segment, track and classify moving objects. In this paper we present the behavior analysis module of the system. A novel method, called dynamic oriented graph (DOG) is used to detect and predict abnormal behaviors, using real-time unsupervised learning. The DOG method characterizes observed actions by means of a structure of unidirectional connected nodes, each one defining a region in the hyperspace of attributes measured from the observed moving objects and having assigned a probability to generate an abnormal behavior. An experimental evaluation with synthetic data was held, where the DOG method outperforms the previously used N-ary trees classifier},

abstract = {Much of the current work in human behaviour modelling concentrates on activity recognition, recognising actions and events through pose, movement, and gesture analysis. Our work focuses on learning and detecting abnormality in higher level behavioural patterns. The hidden Markov model (HMM) is one approach for learning such behaviours given a vision tracker recording observations about a person’s activity. Duration of human activity is an important consideration if we are to accurately model a person’s behavioural patterns. We show how the implicit state duration in the HMM can create a situation in which highly abnormal deviation as either less than or more than the usually observed activity duration can fail to be detected and how the explicit state duration HMM (ESD-HMM) helps alleviate the problem.},

abstract = {We introduce, analyze and demonstrate a recursive hierarchical generalization of the widely used hidden Markov models, which we name Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models (HHMM). Our model is motivated by the complex multi-scale structure which appears in many natural sequences, particularly in language, handwriting and speech. We seek a systematic unsupervised approach to the modeling of such structures. By extendingthe standard forward-backward(BaumWelch) algorithm, we derive an efficient procedure for estimating the model parameters from unlabeled data. We then use the trained model for automatic hierarchical parsing of observation sequences. We describe two applications of our model and its parameter estimation procedure. In the first application we show how to construct hierarchical models of natural English text. In these models different levels of the hierarchy correspond to structures on different length scales in the text. In the second application we demonstrate how HHMMs can b...},

abstract = {Directly modeling the inherent hierarchy and shared structures of human behaviors, we present an application of the hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) for the problem of activity recognition. We argue that to robustly model and recognize complex human activities, it is crucial to exploit both the natural hierarchical decomposition and shared semantics embedded in the movement trajectories. To this end, we propose the use of the HHMM, a rich stochastic model that has been recently extended to handle shared structures, for representing and recognizing a set of complex indoor activities. Furthermore, in the need of real-time recognition, we propose a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) that efficiently computes the filtering distribution at a constant time complexity for each new observation arrival. The main contributions of this paper lie in the application of the sharedstructure HHMM, the estimation of the model’s parameters at all levels simultaneously, and a construction of an RBPF approximate inference scheme. The experimental results in a real-world environment have confirmed our belief that directly modeling shared structures not only reduces computational cost, but also improves recognition accuracy when compared with the tree HHMM and the flat HMM. 1},

abstract = {We propose a new method that treats visible human behaviour at the level of navigational strategies. By inferring intentions in terms of known goals, it is possible to explain the behaviour of people moving around within the field of view of a video camera. The approach presented here incorporates models of navigation from within psychology which are both simple and conceptually plausible, whilst providing good results in an event-detection application. The output is in the form of statements involving goals, such as ''Agent 25 went to exit 8 via sub-goals 34 and 21'' for a given navigational strategy, an image representing the path through the scene, and an overall score for each trajectory. The central algorithm generates all plausible paths through the scene to known goal sites and then compares each path to the agent's actual trajectory thus finding the most likely explanation for their behaviour. Two navigational strategies are examined, shortest path and simplest path. Experimental results are presented for an outdoor car-park and an indoor foyer scene, and our method is found to produce psychologically plausible explanations in the majority of cases. We propose a novel approach to determining the effectiveness of event detection systems, and evaluate the method presented here against this new ground truth. This evaluation method uses human observers to judge the behaviour shown in various video clips, then uses these judgements in correlation with those of the software. We compare the method with a standard machine learning approach based on nearest neighbour. Finally we consider the application of such a system in a binary event-detection or behaviour filtering system.},

We consider the behaviour of pedestrians in terms of motion trajectories, and parametrise these trajectories using the control points of approximating cubic spline curves. This paper demonstrates an incremental semi-supervised one-class learning procedure in which unlabelled trajectories are combined with occasional examples of normal behaviour labelled by a human operator. This procedure is found to be effective on two different datasets, indicating that a human operator could potentially train the system to detect anomalous behaviour by providing only occasional interventions (a small percentage of the total number of observations). 1},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel technique for clustering and classification of object trajectory-based video motion clips using spatiotemporal function approximations. Assuming the clusters of trajectory points are distributed normally in the coefficient feature space, we propose a Mahalanobis classifier for the detection of anomalous trajectories. Motion trajectories are considered as time series and modelled using orthogonal basis function representations. We have compared three different function approximations – least squares polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials and Fourier series obtained by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Trajectory clustering is then carried out in the chosen coefficient feature space to discover patterns of similar object motions. The coefficients of the basis functions are used as input feature vectors to a Self- Organising Map which can learn similarities between object trajectories in an unsupervised manner. Encoding trajectories in this way leads to efficiency gains over existing approaches that use discrete point-based flow vectors to represent the whole trajectory. Our proposed techniques are validated on three different datasets – Australian sign language, hand-labelled object trajectories from video surveillance footage and real-time tracking data obtained in the laboratory. Applications to event detection and motion data mining for multimedia video surveillance systems are envisaged.},

abstract = {During the last years, the task of automatic event analysis in video sequences has gained an increasing attention among the research community. The application domains are disparate, ranging from video surveillance to automatic video annotation for sport videos or TV shots. Whatever the application field, most of the works in event analysis are based on two main approaches: the former based on explicit event recognition, focused on finding highlevel, semantic interpretations of video sequences, and the latter based on anomaly detection. This paper deals with the second approach, where the final goal is not the explicit labeling of recognized events, but the detection of anomalous events differing from typical patterns. In particular, the proposed work addresses anomaly detection by means of trajectory analysis, an approach with several application fields, most notably video surveillance and traffic monitoring. The proposed approach is based on single-class support vector machine (SVM) clustering, where the novelty detection SVM capabilities are used for the identification of anomalous trajectories. Particular attention is given to trajectory classification in absence of a priori information on the distribution of outliers. Experimental results prove the validity of the proposed approach.

Previous approaches to modeling group activity include co-occurrence statistics (individual and joint histograms) and Dynamic Bayesian Networks, neither of which is applicable when the number of interacting objects is large. We treat the objects as point objects (referred to as "landmarks") and propose to model their changing configuration as a moving and deforming "shape" (using Kendall's shape theory for discrete landmarks). A continuous state Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is defined for landmark shape dynamics in an activity. The configuration of landmarks at a given time forms the observation vector and the corresponding shape and the scaled Euclidean motion parameters form the hidden state vector. An abnormal activity is then defined as a change in the shape activity model, which could be slow or drastic and whose parameters are unknown. Results are shown on a real abnormal activity detection problem involving multiple moving objects.},
