% If fractions inside fractions are used, their font gets smaller until they have reached the \scriptstyle limit.
% In order to keep the size consistent, you can declare each fraction to use the display style instead, e.g. by using
% the \displaystyle command:
%

%%
\begin{equation}
x = a_0 + \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_1
+ \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_2
+ \frac{1}{\displaystyle a_3 + a_4}}}
\label{eq:fractions}
\end{equation}

% ********************************************
%
% Figures in figurename.eps format are supported in LaTeX.
% File subdirectory images contains figures used in the template.

\label{fig:smiley}
\end{figure}
%%

%
% Using book documentclass, LaTeX automatically centers captions that fit into single line.
% This can be over-ruled by using justification:
% singlelinecheck=<bool>
% it switches the extra centering off by inserting false, no, off or 0 for <bool>

\end{table}
\vspace{-5mm}
%%

%
% In order to color the first row cell/-s, \rowcolor[gray]{0.9} is used.
% The word 'gray' here denotes the grayscale color scheme, not the color grey and `0.9' denotes how dark the grey is.
%
% The xcolor package provides the necessary commands to produce tables with alternate row colors, when loaded with the table option.
% The command \rowcolors{<starting row>}{<odd color>}{<even color>} has to be specified right before the tabular environment starts.
%
% For footnotes to work inside of tables, apply minipage environment before entering tabular environment.
