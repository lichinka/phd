	potentials 0.25 V negative of the Nernst potential ECo0 of the reaction

  title = {Density Functional Theory -- an introduction},
  organization = {arXiv.org},
  url = {arXiv:physics/9806013v2},
  abstract = {Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used methods
	for ``ab initio'' calculations of the structure of atoms, molecules,
	crystals, surfaces, and their interactions. Unfortunately, the customary
	introduction to DFT is often considered too lengthy to be included
	in various curricula. An alternative introduction to DFT is presented
	here, drawing on ideas which are well-known from thermodynamics,
	especially the idea of switching between different independent variables.
	The central theme of DFT, i.e. the notion that it is possible and
	beneficial to replace the dependence on the external potential v(r)
	by a dependence on the density distribution n(r), is presented as
	a straightforward generalization of the familiar Legendre transform
	from the chemical potential (\mu) to the number of particles (N).
	This approach is used here to introduce the Hohenberg-Kohn energy
	functional and to obtain the corresponding theorems, using classical
	nonuniform fluids as simple examples. The energy functional for electronic
	systems is considered next, and the Kohn-Sham equations are derived.
	The exchange-correlation part of this functional is discussed, including
	both the local density approximation to it, and its formally exact
	expression in terms of the exchange-correlation hole. A very brief
	survey of various applications and extensions is included.},

	of the Mo surface coverage, as well as the appearance of vacancy
	islands in the Au surface after chemically-driven de-alloying of

	the experimental methods for theorists and vice versa, and their

	they have been used together. To give the review a coherent focus
	the examples are confined to studies of adsorbed molecules on semiconductor

	numerous beginners and experts since 1993.
	
	
	The second edition includes a number of new developments in the field.
	Non-contact atomic-force microscopy has demonstrated true atomic
	resolution. It enables direct observation and mapping of individual
	chemical bonds. A new chapter about the underlying physics, atomic
	forces, is added. The chapter on atomic force microscopy is substantially
	expanded. Spin-polarized STM has enabled the observation of local
	magnetic phenomena down to atomic scale. A pedagogical presentation
	of the basic concepts is included. Inelastic scanning tunneling microscopy
	has shown the capability of studying vibrational modes of individual
	molecules. The underlying theory and new instrumentation are added.
	For biological research, to increase the speed of scanning to observe
	life phenomena in real time is a key. Advanced in this direction
	is presented as well. The capability of STM to manipulate individual
	atoms is one of the cornerstones of nanotechnology. The theoretical
	basis and in particular the relation between tunneling and interaction
	energy are thoroughly presented, together with experimental facts.},

	applied to an atomic switch [Nature 352, 600 (1991)]. In this theory
	the bond is broken by overcoming the associated potential barrier
	thanks to a gain in energy from the tunneling electrons. The barrier
	crossing is described by a truncated harmonic oscillator and the
	inelastic electron tunneling is modeled by a simple resonance model
	for the electronic structure. The rate of atom transfer is shown
	to be Arrhenius-like with a vibrational temperature set by the inelastic
	tunneling rate. Characteristic features of this mechanism include
	a crossover from current-driven to thermally activated bond breaking
	with decreasing applied voltage and a power-law dependence of the
	bond-breaking rate with the applied voltage, the latter in agreement
	with experimental findings. We have also identified a current-induced

	of low energy electron diffraction (LEED) which are reviewed in the
	present paper. The arrival of sophisticated and fast techniques for
	the measurement of diffraction intensities in the early 1980s was
	a challenge to theory. Its answer was the development of tensor LEED
	(TLEED) in 1985. It allows the fast calculation of intensities for
	structures not too far from a certain reference. This made quantitative
	surface structure analysis approach new frontiers both with respect
	to structural complexity and-with the help of the routine use of
	reliability factors-to precision. Simultaneously, the new experimental
	techniques allowed access to two-dimensional intensity maps, i.e.
	the measurement of diffuse intensity distributions. Theory could
	be modified to calculate such distributions and so gave birth to
	the diffuse LEED technique (DLEED) which allows the retrieval of
	the local structure in case of disordered adsorption. The basics
	and the development of both TLEED and DLEED is reviewed. TLEED is
	the basis for direct methods and is used in effective search procedures
	for surface structures structurally close to a certain reference.
	It can also be used to simulate the substitution of surface atoms
	by different chemical species as well as to account for surface vibrations.
	In addition to carrying the information about the local structure,
	DLEED patterns very recently could be successfully interpreted in
	a holographic sense yielding real space images directly.},

	verification of the microscopic theory of superconductivity in classical
	superconductors. Initial attempts to apply the same approach to high-temperature
	superconductors were hampered by various problems related to the
	complexity of these materials. The use of scanning tunneling microscopy
	and spectroscopy (STM and STS) on these compounds allowed the main
	difficulties to be overcome. This success motivated a rapidly growing

	over the last decade. The crucial efforts to gain control over the
	technique and to obtain reproducible results are first recalled.
	Then a discussion on how the STM and STS techniques have contributed
	to the study of some of the most unusual and remarkable properties
	of high-temperature superconductors is presented: the unusually large
	gap values and the absence of scaling with the critical temperature,
	the pseudogap and its relation to superconductivity, the unprecedented
	small size of the vortex cores and its influence on vortex matter,
	the unexpected electronic properties of the vortex cores, and the

  abstract = {Cryogenic scanning tunneling spectroscopy is increasingly used to
	study the electronic structure of adatoms, molecules, and semiconductor
	quantum dots. However, the width of the conductance resonances that
	indicate the energy levels is much larger than the thermal energy,
	and this is not well understood. Here, we present a comprehensive
	study of the line shape and width of the conductance resonances observed
	with small colloidal semiconductor quantum dots. Experimentally,
	the line shape and width are studied for CdSe quantum dots of different
	sizes, with nanocrystals being chemically or physically attached
	to the substrate. The influence of the temperature is studied from
	5 K up to room temperature. We have also varied the set-point current
	via the tip-to-dot distance to study the effects of dissipative heating
	of the quantum dot. We present basic calculations of the effects
	of electron-phonon coupling, charge and dipole fluctuations in the
	close environment of the quantum dot, mechanical oscillations of
	the quantum dot in the tunneling junction, and internal heating by
	nonresonant electron transport. A comparison with the experimental
	results shows that electron-phonon coupling forms the main contribution
	to the line broadening for the lowest resonance. Fluctuations of
	the charge landscape around the quantum dot are most likely involved
	in an additional broadening. More importantly, these potential fluctuations
	wash out the vibronic structure of the line shape that should arise
	from electron-phonon coupling. Our results show that in the case
	of semiconductor quantum dots, internal heating due to nonresonant
	electron transport is not important.},

	has been shown to be a spectroscopic method for studying the vibrational
	modes of the whole system. In the present paper we consider the possibility
	of deducing precise information from this spectroscopy. The low-voltage
	part of the spectrum (i.e., the d2I/dV2-vs-V characteristic) gives
	information about the phonons of the electrodes. The phonon density,
	which is deduced for a Mg electrode, is critically compared with
	the density deduced from neutron scattering. The range of this phonon
	probe is then studied by tunneling into multilayer electrodes. The
	40-90-meV range of the characteristic of a Mg-Pb junction exhibits
	a specific structure due to the lattice vibrations of the insulator.
	This structure is compared with the infrared spectrum and the phonon
	density of states of MgO, as well as with a theoretical calculation
	of the tunneling current in the transfer-Hamiltonian formalism. From
	the fit obtained, it is deduced that the 30-?-thick insulator, grown
	on Mg, is an oxide, in contrast with the insulator grown on Al, which
	was previously deduced to be a hydroxide. At higher energies (100-500
	meV), the vibrational spectrum of molecules contained in the insulator
	region is observed. The identification of the lines is shown to be
	accurate and it gives precise information on these molecules, especially
	about their chemical binding with the insulator. This last point
	could be important in the future for studying the problem of adsorption
	on solid surfaces.},

	inelastic manipulations. Mechanical manipulations use the interaction
	between the acting probe (usually a metallic tip) and the targeted
	adsorbate. We review recent results in the field of adsorbate mechanical
	manipulations and explain how manipulations can be effected by using
	the interaction between the probe's tip and certain molecular groups
	of complex chemisorbed molecular systems. On the other hand, inelastic
	manipulations use the tunnelling current to convey energy with sub-??ngstr?m
	precision. This current can excite localized vibrations that can
	induce measurable variations of the tunnelling conductance, hence
	providing a means of detecting single-molecule vibrations. This current
	can also inject energy in a few reaction coordinates. Recently, the
	possibility of vibrational selective manipulations of NH 3 /Cu(100)
	has been experimentally demonstrated. The theory presented here addresses
	the actual pathways accessed when the molecule is excited by the
	tunnelling current from an STM.},

	frame rates up to 200?images/s. These electronics are capable of
	measuring in a fast, completely analog mode as well as in the more
	conventional digital mode. The latter allows measurements at low
	speeds and options, such as, e.g., atom manipulation, currentvoltage
	spectroscopy, or forcedistance curves. For scanning tunneling microscope
	(STM) application we implemented a hybrid mode between the well-known
	constant-height and constant-current modes. This hybrid mode not
	only increases the maximum speed at which the surface can be imaged,
	but also improves the resolution at lower speeds. Acceptable image
	quality at high speeds could only be obtained by pushing the performance
	of each individual part of the electronics to its limit: we developed
	a preamplifier with a bandwidth of 600?kHz, a feedback electronics
	with a bandwidth of 1?MHz, a home-built bus structure for the fast
	data transfer, fast analog to digital converters, and low-noise drivers.
	Future improvements and extensions to the control electronics can
	be realized easily and quickly, because of its open architecture
	with its modular plug-in units. In the second part of this article
	we show our high-speed results. The ultrahigh vacuum application
	of these control electronics on our (UHV)-STM enabled imaging speeds
	up to 0.3?mm/s, while still obtaining atomic step resolution. At
	high frame rates, the images suffered from noticeable distortions,
	which we have been able to analyze by virtue of the unique access
	to the error (dZ) signal. The distortions have all been associated
	with mechanical resonances in the scan head of the UHV-STM. In order
	to reduce such resonance effects, we have designed and built a scan
	head with high resonance frequencies (<= 64?kHz), especially for
	the purpose of testing the fast electronics. Using this scanner we
	have reached video-rate imaging speeds up to 200?frames/s (5?ms/image),

	(STM) image of a dense metal surface shows a giant amplitude, i.e.,

	an s-wave tip. To date, no satisfactory explanation has been given.
	Using our earlier nonperturbative formalism for the tunnel current,
	we reconsider the corrugation problem with a single atom tip having
	s, p, or d orbitals, or a combination. Particular emphasis is on
	the value of the corrugation as a function of the tunnel resistance
	?l,m(R). Results show that the corrugation, observed over the wide
	range (105-108?), is inconsistent by nearly two orders of magnitude
	with the s-orbital theory, and by one order of magnitude with the
	dz2 one. We also can put aside tip-surface interactions. Tip states,
	such as pz and dz2, give basically s-wave behavior in ?l,m(R). However,
	those with axial symmetry, such as dxz+idyz and having a nodal line
	orthogonal to the surface, give an enhanced corrugation. Finally,
	in tip states with a nodal plane, such as dx2-y2, the enhancement
	effect is much more pronounced. Identical results are obtained by
	considering separately the nearly free electron model, and a new
	method of atomic orbital superposition, for the metal surface.},

  abstract = {The present topical review focuses on recent advances concerning an
	intriguing phenomenon in condensed matter physics, the scattering
	of conduction electrons at the localized spin of a magnetic impurity:
	the Kondo effect. Spectroscopic signatures of this effect have been
	observed in the past by high-resolution photoemission which, however,
	has the drawback of averaging over a typical surface area of 1mm
	2 . By combining the atomic-scale spatial resolution of the scanning
	tunneling microscope (STM) with an energy resolution of a few tens
	of 碌eV achievable nowadays in scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS),
	and by exposing the magnetic adatom to external magnetic fields,
	our understanding of the interaction of a single magnetic impurity
	with the conduction electrons of the nonmagnetic host has been considerably
	deepened. New insight has emerged by taking advantage of quantum
	size effects in the metallic support and by decoupling the magnetic
	adatom from the supporting host metal, for instance by embedding
	it inside a molecule or by separating it by an ultrathin insulating
	film from the metal surface. In this way, Kondo resonances and Kondo
	temperatures can be tailored and manipulated by changing the local
	density of states of the environment. In the weak coupling limit
	between a Kondo impurity and a superconductor only a convolution
	of tip and sample DOS is observed while for strongly coupled systems
	midgap states appear, indicating superconducting pair breaking. Magnetic
	impurities with co-adsorbed hydrogen on metallic surfaces show pseudo-Kondo
	resonances owing to very low-energy vibrational excitations detected
	by inelastic tunneling spectroscopy. One of the most recent achievements
	in the field has been the clarification of the role of magnetic anisotropy
	in the Kondo effect for localized spin systems with a spin larger
	than S = 1/2.},

	(TPD) measurements have revealed that the straight step edges of
	Cu(533) surfaces are reconstructed by the room temperature adsorption
	of R-3-methylcyclohexanone (R-3-MCHO). STM and low energy electron
	diffraction (LEED) investigations have shown that the clean Cu(533)
	surface is composed of arrays of narrow (111) terraces separated
	by straight (100) steps. During room temperature adsorption of
	R-3-MCHO, the (100) step edges on the Cu(533) surface reconstruct,
	adopting a zigzag structure that exposes kinked, high Miller index
	step edges. The density of step edge and kink adsorption sites on
	Cu surfaces can be titrated by TPD of R-3-MCHO. TPD experiments also
	reveal the formation of kinks on the Cu(533) surface during room
	temperature adsorption of R-3-MCHO. Furthermore, TPD experiments
	on the Cu(221) surface having straight (110) step edges indicate
	that these also reconstruct to expose kinked step edges during R-3-MCHO
	adsorption at room temperature. Although the kinks on such surfaces
	are chiral, the R- and S-forms appear to be produced in a roughly
	racemic (equimolar) ratio. Thus, although the reconstruction of the
	initially achiral Cu surfaces in the presence of a chiral adsorbate
	could, in principle, lead to a surface with a net chiral structure,
	R-3-MCHO does not seem to be an effective chiral imprinting agent.},

	Second Edition features contributions from distinguished scientists
	working in a wide range of specialties at university, commercial,
	and government research labs around the world. Chapters have been
	edited for clarity, conciseness, and uniformity of presentation to
	provide professionals with a concise working reference to scanning
	probe microscopic and spectroscopic principles, techniques, and practices.
	
	
	This Second Edition has been substantially revised and expanded to
	reflect important advances and new applications. In addition to numerous
	examples, the Second Edition features expanded coverage of electrostatic
	and magnetic force microscopies, nearfield optical microscopies,
	and new applications of buried interfaces in nanomechanics, electrochemistry,
	and biology.
	
	
	Scanning Probe Microscopy and Spectroscopy, Second Edition is an indispensable
	working resource for surface scientists, microscopists, and spectroscopists
	in materials science, chemistry, engineering, biochemistry, physics,
